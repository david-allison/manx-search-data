AN EXHORTATION AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH.,RAUE NOI AGGLE Y VAAISH.,,,1
"It is not to be marvelled that worldly men do fear to die. For death depriveth them of all worldly honours, riches, and possessions, in the fruition whereof the worldly man counteth himself happy, so long as he may enjoy them at his own pleasure; and otherwise, if he be dispossessed of the same, without hope of recovery, then he can no otherwise think of himself, but that he is unhappy; because he hath lost his worldly joy and pleasure.","Cha nee yindys eh dy vel cloan y theihll shoh goaill aggle dy gheddyn baase. Son ta baase spooilley ad jeh dy chooilley ooashley, berchys as cooid seihlt, ayndoo ta’n dooinney seihltagh soiaghey e vaynrys, choud as oddys eh goaill soylley jeu ec e aigney; as er aght elley, my t’eh er ny scarrey veih ny reddyn shoh fegooish treishteil jeh cosney ad reesht, eisht cha vod eh jeeaghyn er hene agh mee- vaynrey; er-yn-oyr dy vel eh er choayll e voggey as e eunys seihltagh.",,,1
"Alas, thinketh this carnal man, shall I now depart for ever from all my honours, all my treasure; from my country, friends, riches, possessions, and worldly pleasures, which are my joy and heart’s delight? Alas, that ever that day should come, when all these I must bid farewell at once, and never to enjoy any of them after.","Ales! ta’n dooinney foalley shoh smooinaghtyn, negin dou nish Scarrey son dy bragh rish ooilley my ooashley, ooilley my verchys; my heer, my chaarjyn, my chooid, as eunyssyn seihltagh, ta boggey my chree. Ales! dy darragh y laa shen dy bragh, tra shegin dou coayll ooilley ny reddyn shoh, as gyn arragh soylley y ghoaill jeh veg jeu.",,,2
"Wherefore it is not without great cause spoken of the Wise Man, O death, how bitter and sour is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth in peace and prosperity in his substance; to a man living at ease, leading his life after his own mind without trouble, and is therewithal well pampered and fed! Ecclus. xii. ","Shen-y-fa cha nee fegooish lane oyr dy vel yn dooinney creeney gra, O vaase, cre cha sharroo as ta’n smooinaghtyn jeeds da’n dooinney ta baghey ec aash ayns e chummallyn, da’n dooinney nagh vel nhee erbee echey dy heaghney eh as ta bishaghey ayns dy chooilley nhee. [Ecclus. xii. 1].","Shen-y-fa cha nee fegooish lane oyr dy vel yn dooinney creeney gra, O vaase, cre cha sharroo as ta’n smooinaghtyn jeeds da’n dooinney ta baghey ec aash ayns e chummallyn, da’n dooinney nagh vel nhee erbee echey dy heaghney eh as ta bishaghey ayns dy chooilley nhee.",,2
"There be other men, whom this world doth not so greatly laugh upon, but rather vex and oppress with poverty, sickness, or some other adversity: yet they do fear death, partly because the flesh abhorreth naturally its own sorrowful dissolution, which death doth threaten to them; and partly by reason of sicknesses and painful diseases, which be most strong pangs and agonies in the flesh, and use commonly to come to sick men before death, or at the least accompany death, whensoever it cometh. ","Ta deiney elley ayn nagh vel y theihll wheesh cheet lhieu, agh er y laue elley seaghney lesh boghtinyd, chingys ny arkys ennagh elley; ny-yeih ta’d ayns aggle jeh baase, ayns ayrn, er-yn-oyr dy vel yn eill dy dooghyssagh chea veih’n toyrtmow eck hene, lesh ta’n baase dy vaggyrt ad; as ayns ayrn kindagh rish chingys as doghanyn piandagh, ta coyrt lhieu trimshey as angaishyn er y challin, as ta dy cadjin cheet er sleih ching roish baase, ny ec y chooid sloo cheet marish y vaase, cre-erbee yn traa t’eh dy verraghtyn orrin.",,,2
"Although these two causes seem great and weighty to a worldly man, whereupon he is moved to fear death; yet there is another cause much greater than any of these afore rehearsed, for which indeed he hath just cause to fear death; and that is, the state and condition whereunto at the last end death bringeth all them that have their hearts fixed upon this world, without repentance and amendment: This state and condition is called the second death, which unto all such shall ensue after this bodily death..","Ga dy vel y daa oyr shoh jeeaghyn dy ve jeh lane trimmid da dooinney seihltagh, as geginagh eh dy ve agglagh roish baase, ny-yeih ta oyr stroshey na veg te’r ve hannah enmyssit, er-y-hon te resoonagh da dy ve ayns aggle, as ta shen yn stayd huggey ta baase ec y jerrey coyrt lesh ooilley adsyn ta soiaghey nyn greeaghyn er y theihll shoh, fegooish arrys as lhiassaghey bea.

Ja’n stayd shoh enmyssit yn nah vaase hig er ooilley nyn lheid lurg baase y challin.",,2
"And this is that death which indeed ought to be dreaded and feared: for it is an everlasting loss, without remedy, of the grace and favour of God, and of everlasting joy, pleasure, and felicity","As ta shoh dy jarroo yn baase roish lhisagh aggle ve goit; son te coayll dy bragh farraghtyn, fegooish couyr, jeh grayse as foayr Yee, as jeh boggey as maynrys dy bragh farraghtyn.",,,3
And it is not only the loss for ever of all these eternal pleasures; but also it is the condemnation both of body and soul (without either appellation or hope of redemption) unto everlasting pains in hell. ,"As cha vel eh ynrycan coayll son dy bragh ny eunyssyn flaunyssagh shoh agh te myrgeddin deyrey chammah callin as annym, (fegooish treishteil erbee jeh caghlaa) gys torchagh dy bragh farraghtyn ayns niurin. ",,,3
"Unto this state death sent the unmerciful and ungodly rich man (that Luke speaketh of in his Gospel,) who living in all wealth and pleasure in this world, and cherishing himself daily with dainty fare, and gorgeous apparel, despised poor Lazarus, that lay pitiful at his gate, miserably plagued and full of sores, and also grievously pined with hunger. Luke xvi.","Gys y stayd shoh hug baase lesh yn dooinney berchagh neu-vyghinagh as mee-chrauee (ta loayrit jeh ayns Sushtal y Noo Luke) eshyn va baghey ayns dy chooilley verchys as eunys ’sy theihll shoh, as jannoo mooar jeh hene lesh beaghey soaillagh as coamrey moyrnagh, as ren beg y hoiaghey jeh Lazarus boght, va ny lhie ayns stayd treih ec e ghiatt fo surranse trome, as laane dy hingyn, as myrgeddin seaghnit lesh feme. (Luke xvi. 19–31)","Gys y stayd shoh hug baase lesh yn dooinney berchagh neu-vyghinagh as mee-chrauee (ta loayrit jeh ayns Sushtal y Noo Luke) eshyn va baghey ayns dy choilley verchys as eunys ’sy theihll shoh, as jannoo mooar jeh hene lesh beaghey soilagh as coamrey moyrnagh, as ren beg y hoiaghey jeh Lazarus boght, va ny lhie ayns stayd treih ec e ghiatt fo surranse trome, as laane dy hingyn, as myrgeddin seaghnit lesh feme. (Luke xvi.)",,3
"Both these two were arrested by death, which sent Lazarus, the poor miserable man, by angels anon unto Abraham’s bosom; a place of rest, pleasure, and consolation: but the unmerciful rich man descended down into hell; and being in torments, he cried for comfort, complaining of the intolerable pain that he suffered in that flame of fire; but it was too late. ","Va’n daa ghooinney shoh goit ersooyl liorish baase hug lesh Lazarus, yn dooinney boght as seaghnit liorish Ainlyn chelleeragh gys oghrish Abraham, ynnyd dy hee, dy eunys as dy gherjagh; agh hie yn dooinney neu-vyghinagh sheese gys Niurin, as choud’s v’eh er ny horchaghey, deïe eh son ooraghey, gaccan dy row e hurranse erskyn-towse atchimagh ayns y lossey shen dy aile; agh ve ro-anmagh.",,,3
"So unto this place bodily death sendeth all them that in this world have their joy and felicity, all them that in this world be unfaithful unto God, and uncharitable unto their neighbours, so dying without repentance and hope of God’s mercy.","Myrgeddin gys y voayll shoh ta baase y challin coyrt lesh ooilley adsyn ta ’sy theihll shoh geddyn nyn maynrys as nyn moggey, ooilley ta neu-firrinagh gys Jee er y thalloo, as mee-ghiastyllagh gys nyn Naboonyn, as gheddyn baase ’sy stayd shen, fegooish arrys as treishteil jeh myghin Yee.",,,4
"Wherefore it is no marvel, that the worldly man feareth death: for he hath much more cause so to do, than he himself doth consider. ",Shen-y-fa cha nee yindys eh dy vel y dooinney seihltagh agglagh roish baase; son ta ny smoo dy oyr echey dy ve agglagh na t’eh hene toiggal. ,,,4
The first,,,,4
Thus we see three causes why worldly men fear death. ,Myr shoh ta shin fakin three oyryn er nyn son ta cloan y theihll shoh ayns aggle jeh baase. ,,,4
"One, because they shall lose thereby their worldly honours, riches, possessions, and all their heart’s desires:","Ta’n chied oyr dy gaill ad liorish baase nyn ooashley seihltagh, nyn merchys, as ooilley mian nyn gree:",,,4
Second,,,,4
"another, because of the painful diseases, and bitter pangs, which commonly men suffer, either before, or at the time of death:","ta ny doghanyn piandagh as angaishyn sharroo ta sleih dy cadjin surranse, eddyr roish, ny ec oor y vaaish,",,,4
Third,,,,4
"but the chief cause above all other, is the dread of the miserable state of eternal damnation both of body and soul, which they fear shall follow, after their departing from the worldly pleasures of this present life.","oyr elley, agh yn oyr s’troshey ooilley, te yn aggle dy jean treihys dy bragh farraghtyn chammah jeh corp as annym berraghtyn orroo, lurg daue v’er nyn scarrey veih nyn eunyssyn seihltagh.",,,4
"For these causes be all mortal men (which be given to the love of this world) both in fear, and state of death, through sin (as the holy Apostle saith) so long as they live here in this world: Heb. x.","Son ny oyryn shoh ta dy chooilley ghooinney marvaanagh (ta sluggit seose lesh graih yn theihll shoh) chammah ayns aggle roish as ayns stayd dy vaase, trooid peccah myr ta’n Ostyl casherick gra choud’s t’ad er y thalloo. (Heb. ii. 15.)","Son ny oyryn shoh ta dy chooilley ghoinney marvaanagh (ta sluggit seose lesh graih yn theihll shoh) chammah ayns aggle roish as ayns stayd dy vaase, trooid peccah myr ta’n Ostyl casherick gra choud’s t’ad er y thalloo. (Heb. ii. 15.)",,4
"but (everlasting thanks be to Almighty God for ever) there is never a one of all these causes, no, nor yet they all together, that can make a true Christian man afraid to die (who is the very member of Christ, the temple of the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. iii.","Agh, booise dy row gys Jee ooilley-niartal son dy bragh, cha vel unnane jeh ny oyryn shoh, chamoo ooilley ny oyryn shoh dy cheilley, oddys coyrt er Creestee firrinagh goaill aggle dy gheddyn baase—eshyn ta eer, olt jeh Creest, chiamble y Spyrryd Noo (1 Cor. iii. 16.)",,,4
"the son of God, and the very inheritor of the everlasting kingdom of heaven:) but plainly contrary, he conceiveth great and many causes, undoubtedly grounded upon the infallible and everlasting truth of the Word of God, which move him, not only to put away the fear of bodily death, but also, for the manifold benefits and singular commodities, which ensue unto every faithful person by reason of the same, to wish, desire, and long heartily for it.","Liannoo dy Yee, as eer eirey jeh reeriaght dy bragh farraghtyn Niau— agh er y laue elley ta ymmodee oyryn fondagh echey, gruntit er Goo Yee, nagh vod dy bragh shin y volley ta greinnaghey eh cha nee ynrican dy chur ersooyl aggle jeh baase y challln, agh myrgeddin, er coontey ny ymmodee vondeishyn costal, te coyrt lesh gys dy chooilley credjuagh firrinagh dy yeearree dy jeean er y hon, as dy ghoaill foddeeaght ny lurg.",,,5
"For death shall be to him no death at all, but a very deliverance from death, from all pains, cares, and sorrows, miseries, and wretchedness of this world, and the very entry into rest, and a beginning of everlasting joy, a tasting of heavenly pleasures, so great, that neither tongue is able to express, neither eye to see, nor ear to hear them; no, nor any earthly man’s heart to conceive them.","Son cha bee baase dasyn baase erbee, agh livreys veih baase, veih dy chooilley phian, kiarail, seaghyn, trimshey as treihys y theihll, as eer goll stiagh ayns fea, as toshiaght jeh boggey dy bragh farraghtyn, ennaghtyn jeh eunysssyn flaunyssagh cha gerjoilagh shen nagh vod eddyr chengey fockley magh ad, ny sooill fakin ad, ny cleaysh clashtyn ad; chamoo oddys cree dooinney seihltagh erbee[3] ad y hoiggal.","Son cha bee baase dasyn baase erbee, agh livreys veih baase, veih dy chooilley phian, kiarail, seaghyn, trimshey as treihys y theihll, as eer goll stiagh ayns fea, as toshiaght jeh boggey dy bragh farraghtyn, ennaghtyn jeh eunysssyn flaunyssagh cha gerjoilagh shen nagh vod eddyr chengey fockley magh ad, ny sooill fakin ad, ny cleaysh clashtyn ad; chamoo oddys cree dooinney seihltagh arbee ad y hoiggal.",[3] erbee] text arbee; there are a few other such examples in this homily.,5
"So exceeding great benefits they be, which God our heavenly Father by his mere mercy, and for the love of his Son Jesus Christ, hath laid up in store, and prepared for them that humbly submit themselves to God’s will, and evermore unfeignedly love him from the bottom of their hearts. ","Wheesh shen ta ny vondeishyn ta Jee nyn Ayr flaunyssagh liorish e vyghin nastee, as er graih e Vac Yeesey Creest er stoyral seose, as er chiarail ny chour ocsyn ta dy imlee ginjillaghey ad-hene gys aigney Yee, as dy bragh coyrt graih da veih grunt nyn gree. ",,,5
"And we ought to believe, that death, being slain by Christ, cannot keep any man that steadfastly trusteth in Christ, under his perpetual tyranny and subjection; but that he shall rise from death again unto glory at the last day, appointed by Almighty God, like as Christ our Head did rise again, according to God’s appointment, the third day.","As lhisagh shin credjal nagh vod baase, t’er ny varroo liorish Creest, dooinney erbee ta dy shlckyr treishteil ayns Creest, dy kinjagh y reayll fo e reill, agh dy jean eh girree reesht veih baase gys gloyr ec y laa jerrinagh, er ny phointeil liorish lee ooilley-niartal, myr ren Creest nyn gione girree reesht, cordail rish oardagh Yee, yn trass laa.","As lhisagh shin credjal nagh vod baase, t’er ny varroo liorish Creest, dooinney arbee ta dy shlckyr treishteil ayns Creest, dy kinjagh y reayll fo e reill, agh dy jean eh girree reesht veih baase gys gloyr ec y laa jerrinagh, er ny phointeil liorish lee ooilley-niartal, myr ren Creest nyn gione girree reesht, cordail rish oardagh Yee, yn trass laa.",,5
"For St. Augustine saith, The Head going before, the members trust to follow and come after. And St. Paul saith, If Christ be risen from the dead, we shall rise also from the same. And to comfort all Christian persons herein, holy Scripture calleth this bodily death a sleep, wherein man’s senses be (as it were) taken from him for a season; and yet when he awaketh, he is more fresh than he was when he went to bed.","Son ta Augustine gra, Myr t’an kione er n’gholl roin, ta ny oltyn treishteil dy eiyrt er. As ta Noo Paul gra, My ta Creest er n’irree veih ny merriu, nee shinyn myrgeddin girree.

"So, although we have our souls separated from our bodies for a season, yet at the general resurrection we shall be more fresh, beautiful, and perfect than we be now. ","Myr shoh ga dy vel nyn anmeenyn er nyn scarrey veih nyn gallinyn son earish, ny-yeih ec yn irree-seose- reesht bee mayd ny s’bioyre, as ny s’aalin; as ny s’glenney na ta shin nish.

"For now we be mortal, then shall we be immortal; now infected with divers infirmities, then clearly void of all mortal infirmities: now we be subject to all carnal desires, then we shall be all spiritual, desiring nothing but God’s glory, and things eternal.","Son nish ta shin foshlit roish baase, agh eisht bee mayd bio son dy bragh, nish ta shin fo ymmodee annoonidyn, agh eisht bee mayd er nyn eaysley veih dy chooilley annoonid, nish ta shin foshlit roish ooilley yeearreeyn ny foalley, eisht bee mayd ooilley spyrrydoil, gyn veg y yeearree agh gloyr Yee, as reddyn dy bragh farraghtyn.","Son nish ta shin foshlit roish baase, agh eisht bee mayd bio son dy bragh, nish ta shin fo ymmodee annoonidyn, agh eisht bee mayd er nyn eaysley veih dy chooilley annoonid, nish ta shin foshlit roish ooilley yearreeyn ny foalley, eisht bee mayd ooilley spyrrydoil, gyn veg y yeearree agh gloyr Yee, as reddyn dy bragh farraghtyn.",,6
"Thus is this bodily death a door or entering unto life, and therefore not so much dreadful (if it be rightly considered) as it is comfortable; not a mischief, but a remedy for all mischief; no enemy, but a friend; not a cruel tyrant, but a gentle guide, leading us not to mortality, but to immortality, not to sorrow and pain, but to joy and pleasure, and that to endure for ever, if it be thankfully taken and accepted as God’s messenger, and patiently borne of us for Christ’s love, that suffered most painful death for our love, to redeem us from death eternal.

"St. Paul also saith, that Christ is ordained and made of God our righteousness, our holiness, and redemption, 1 Cor. i. to the intent that he which will glory should glory in the Lord.","Ta Noo Paul myrgeddin gra, “dy vel Creest liorish Jee er ny yannoo dooinyn creenaght, as cairys, as casherickys, as livrey-ys.” (1 Cor. i. 30.)","Ta Noo Paul myrgeddin gra dy vel Creest liorish Jee er ny yannoo dooinyn creenaght, as cairys, as casherickys, as livrey-ys.” (1 Cor. i. 30.)",,7

"Finally, St. Paul maketh a plain argument on this wise, If our heavenly Father would not spare his own natural Son, but did give him to death for us; how can it be, that with him he should not give us all things? Rom. viii.","Er jerrey ta Noo Paul loayrt dy baghtal er yn aght shoh. “Eshyn nagh ren e Vac hene y haghney, agh livrey eh eh seose er nyn son ooilley, kys nagh der eshyn dooin myrgeddin dy arryltagh marishyn dy chooilley nhee?” (Rom. viii. 32.)","Er jerrey ta Noo Paul loayrt dy baghtal er yn aght shop. “Eshyn nagh ren e Vac hene y haghney, agh livrey eh eh seose er nyn son ooilley, kys nagh der eshyn dooin myrgeddin dy arryltagh marishyn dy chooilley nhee?

"The second, the fear of the pangs and pains that come with death.","Yn nah oyr, aggle jeh ny angaishyn as pianyn ta cheet marish baase.",,,8

"The faithful Christian man which considereth all these miseries, perils, and incommodities (whereunto he is subject so long as he here liveth upon earth,) and on the other part considereth that blessed and comfortable state of the heavenly life to come, and the sweet condition of them that depart in the Lord; how they are delivered from the continual encumbrances of their mortal and sinful body, from all the malice, crafts, and deceits of this world, from all the assaults of their ghostly enemy the Devil; to live in peace, rest and endless quietness, to live in the fellowship of innumerable angels, and with the congregation of perfect and just men, as patriarchs, prophets, martyrs, and confessors, and finally unto the presence of Almighty God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:— he that doth consider all these things, and believeth them assuredly, as they are to be believed, even from the bottom of his heart, being established in God in this true faith, having a quiet conscience in Christ, a firm hope and assured trust in God’s mercy, through the merits of Jesus Christ to obtain this quietness, rest, and everlasting joy, shall not only be without fear of bodily death, when it cometh, but certainly, as St. Paul did, so shall he gladly (according to God’s will, and when it pleaseth God to call him out of this life) greatly desire in his heart, Phil. i. that he may be rid from all these occasions of evil, and live ever to God’s pleasure, in perfect obedience of his will, with our Saviour Jesus Christ; to whose gracious presence the Lord of his infinite mercy and grace bring us, to reign with him in life everlasting: to whom, with our heavenly Father, and the Holy Ghost, be glory in worlds without end.
