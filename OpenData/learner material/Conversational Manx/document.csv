"A Series of graded lessons in Manx and English, introducing the student quickly and easily to idiomatic and conversational Manx Gaelic.",,
Dedication,,
"In affectionate memory of those native Manx people from whom I got the Manx and with whom in their homes I found such friendship, kindness and hospitality.","Ayns cooinaghtyn ghraihagh jeh ooilley ny Manninee dooie shen veuesyn hooar mish y Ghailck, as maroosyn ayns nyn dhieyn hooar mee lheid y caarjys, kenjallys, as giastyllys.",
"Alas! Most of them are now gone, and there will never be their like among us again. God’s Peace be with them.",,
Introduction,,
"The author in need of an introduction for his book usually prevails upon some well-known but kindly disposed personality to recommend his work. The seal of solid respectability thus set upon it sends the book off to a flying start and dispels from the minds of timorous readers all doubts as to its soundness. Not so, however, is Mr Gell. He is not interested in the impression his book may have upon the eminent, but only in its value to the ordinary people — of which I am one, and so, if I, as an ordinary man, think that his work is valuable, it is fair to believe that other ordinary men and women will do so too. ",,
"     For many years I have been interested in the Gaelic languages, and have seen numerous text-books designed to help the learner. Some I have found very good; others less useful. Amongst them all Juan y Geill’s volume is practically unique, in that it meets squarely the real difficulty which must be found in learning a language; that the language is primarily spoken.",,
"     Now the ability to speak a language fluently does not lie so much in the possession of a good vocabulary and a sound knowledge of its grammar, as in the ability to string words into phrases and sentences with the rythym and accent given to them by the native speakers. Many dictionaries and text-books give the pronunciation of single words, but all too few tell us the sound of these same words when used in conversation.",,
"     For the student of Manx, unable to spend time with a native speaker, this difficulty has in the past been quite insuperable, Kneen’s Dictionary alone has revealed what hitherto was an exasperating secret; how to pronounce the Manx. Mr Gell’s book carries the work to its logical conclusion and tells us how to speak it.",,
"     In the matter of pronunciation he has followed the conventions adopted by the late J. J. Kneen, with a few exceptions. Undoubtedly, argument could be brought forward for the use of the conventional signs of the International Phonetic Alphabet, and such arguments would be cogent, but, to the ordinary student, the system as used by Kneen, which is related to English syllables as pronounced in the Island, must necessarily have the appeal of simplicity. In my own opinion Mr. Gell is wise in adopting it rather than the moe difficult Phonetic Alphabet.",,
"     The sentences and phrases should be spoken rythmically with the accent as shown in heavy type, and having thus attained some fluency in using the set phrases, it is a relatively simple step without losing either rhythm or fluency.",,
"     Finally, practise as often and as regularly as possible — speak the language and keep on speaking it, for its life and preservation is both a charge upon the conscience, and a challenge to the patriotism of this generation!",,
"[Long live our language, and to every student of Manx I would say, Good luck to you!]","Dy voddey beayn yn ghlare ain, as rish dy chooilley studeyr ny Ghailck yiarrins, Raah dy row ort!",

Preface,,
"     FOR some years past, students and teachers of the Manx Language have felt the need for a series of graded exercises in conversational Manx, and to meet this demand these lessons were prepared and pub­ lished in weekly instalments by the ""Mona's Herald"" last winter. They now appear in book form in the hope that they will enable even the casual reader to learn a few phrases, and the more serious student to become conversant with the idiom and fluent in speaking our ancient mother tongue.",,
"     The pronunciation of Manx is a very real difficulty, and even with the assistance of a native speaker, the English tongue cannot quite re­ produce the true Gaelic sounds. Admittedly, those who acquired the language in childhood from parents or grandparents are the best speakers, but such alas, are reduced in number to a mere handful, and even the Anglo-Manx dialect, so rich in the idiom and so full of true Gaelic words, has almost disappeared so that most students have no choice but to try to learn the pronunciation from imitated phonetic symbols.",,
"Unfortunately, no system of English spelling can adequately represent the spoken Manx; the best would undoubtedly be the International Phonetic Alphabet, but this in itself would create still more difficulty for the average student. Hence, I have conformed in general to the system used by the late Mr. J. J. Kneen in his English-Manx Pronouncing Dictionary, a second edition of which has recently been published by the Mona's Herald Press, and which I whole-heartedly commend to the student for a full explanation of the phonetic symbols and a valuable aid to building up a good vocabulary.",,
Note the following variations from Mr. Kneen’s system:,,
"a is used for that indeterminate vowel heard in English ‘about’, or the short ‘e’ in ‘the boy’.",,
"     ch always as in English church. This is the equivalent of the slender ‘t’ in Gaelic.  (e.g. Manx, 'cheer', a  country = Gaelic, 'tir'.)",,
"     ch represents the aspirate of ‘c’ or ‘k’, pronounced as the Scot would say ‘loch’.",,
"The t. and d. as used by Mr. Kneen cause some difficulty, so I have used t.th and d.th. These may look clumsy, but they give a better idea of the sound : viz.",,
     ayns y thie like English in 'unset thigh.',,
     towse  as in Lancs. dialect  ‘t.thouse’,,
     deyr like English ‘wanted there’,,
     dou like English ‘said thou’,,
"The short vowel a and e, also o and u, are not so distinct as in English; in the dialect one would hear ‘donkey’ pronounced almost as 'd.thunkey,' and the word 'better' as 'bat.tha.' Note also that the ‘oo’ in Manx is always long, as in the English ‘mood’ - a true Manxman will pronounce ‘good’ as though written ‘gude’.",,
"I must emphasise that phonetics can only approximate to the actual spoken Manx, and I strongly advise those who can, to attend the Manx Language classes, or better still, spend some time with a native speaker if that is possible.",,
"Finally, I hope that the Manx Language Society will have all the Manx sections of these lessons recorded on the tape machine, and copies made available for use in the Language classes and for individual students, so that in the years to come, when our last native speaker will, alas, have passed away, the pronunciation of Manx will be assured.",,

Notes on Lesson 1,,
"1. Much use is made in colloquial Manx of the first person singular, thee and thou, especially when speaking to a person one knows well, but the plural ‘shiu’ is used out of courtesy to an elder or a stranger.",,

"15. ‘She’, the assertive verb ‘to be’, meaning ‘Tis’, the negative of which is ‘Cha nee’.",,
"19. ‘marym’, most propositions combine with the personal pronouns giving a special form for each person. Note also that ‘marym, mayrt, marish,’ etc., mean, ‘along with’, ‘in company with’, as opposed to ‘lesh’ which usually implies possession.",,
"20. ‘edyr’, an interjection often used in Manx idiom. ",,
"‘dy-valley ', the word ‘balley’ means a place, town, homestead or farm, and ‘Dy-valley’ is the adverbial form. ‘Thie’ = house or home, and is used adverbially without ‘dy’, as in No. 10.",,

Notes on Lesson 2.,,
"1. & 2. There is no word for afternoon’ in Manx. ‘Fastyr’ is used for any time after mid-day until nightfall. Note also the vocative case when addressing a person, which causes aspiration in certain initial consonants; hence M to V in Vainshter, and J to Y in Yuan.",,
"3. ‘Laa-feailley’ = literally, a feast day, as were all the oldtime ‘holy’ days.",,
4. S’mie = a contraction of ‘she mie’ = ’Tis good. Many idiomatic com­ binations of the assertive verb ‘she’ and adjective or proposition are found in all Gaelic languages.,,
"6. ‘feer’ =v ery, truly; one of the prefixed adjectives causing aspiration in the noun.",,
"7. ‘feayr’, pronounced ‘foor’, or ‘fuar’ as in Erse and Scots Gaelic, though in the West and North of the Island it sounds like ‘feer’ or the German ‘fur’.",,
"13. Two, in counting is ‘jees,’ but ‘daa’ is the adjective and is followed by the singular noun, not plural as in English. It also causes aspiration.",,
"15. Note the article before ‘Ballaskeg.’ (The Ballaskeg.) This could mean of course, the Hawthorn Farm, but colloquially would refer to the man who owned or farmed Ballaskeg. ‘neesht’ = also, too; and pronounced ‘n’yiss’.",,
"Much, many.= mooaran or ymmodee, but in the negative or interrogative, ‘monney’ is used. ‘Ram’ = a lot. This is a word commonly used, though not given in any dictionary.",,

Notes on Lesson 4,,
"1. ‘peiagh,’ or ‘pyagh,’ = a person. Some think that this is synonomous with ‘peccagh,’ a sinner (‘All men are sinners’?) Certainly ‘peccagh’ as pronounced by native speakers, with the medial ‘cc’  slurred, would give much .the same sound.",,
"5. ‘edyr.’ = at all, an idiomatic interjection often used in Gaelic, and in the dialect. Not to be confused with ‘erbee,’ meaning none at all, or with ‘eddyr,’ a preposition meaning ‘between.’",,
"8. ‘Yes and No,’ have no counterpart in Manx. They can only be expressed by a repetition of the verb used in the question, hence, ‘Daink shiu?’ ‘Haink,’ Yes. ‘Cha daink,’ No.",,
9. ‘neayr’s’ pronounced as ‘n’yirrus.’,,
11. ‘cha nel .... agh.’ (Is not .... but.) Similar to the Yorks. dialect,,
‘He is nobbut ... .’,,
"12. ‘er-lhiam,’ an idiom peculiar to Gaelic and cannot be translated literally. It means, ‘methinks, I imagine, etc.’ Similarly with other persons. ‘Er.lhiat, er-lesh. etc.’",,
"14. ‘e lheid,’ = anyone like her, her sort, her kind of person.",,
"16. ‘trome’ = heavy. Here used as an intensive, as ‘very sick’ or ‘exceedingly ill.’",,
"18. ‘derrey’ as an adverb, means ‘until,’ but here the idiom is ‘yn derrey yeh as yn jeh elley.’ (The one .... and the other.) Any other noun can take the place of ‘yeh and jeh.’",,
"19. The Manx idiom is ‘to look on something,’ not ‘at,’ as in English.",,

Notes on Lesson 8,,
"3. Could be translated, “How long it is since ...”",,
"5. ‘mleeaney,’ an example of eclipsis, as in Irish, ‘im bliadhna.’ (lit. = in the year.)",,
"6 ‘jeh,’ can mean both ‘of’ and ‘off.'",,
"7. Notice that in Manx, prepositions implying motion have a different form to that implymg rest, and also that two are required in Manx (magh ass y phurt = outwards out of the harbour.)",,
"8. ‘eeastee,’ the genitive form = of fishing (ollagh = cattle· thie-ollee cattle house.)",,
"10. ‘skeddan,’ generally considered as a collective noun, no plural required.",,
11. ‘ec  y traa t’ayn’ = at the time (that’s) in.,,
12. Adjectives generally follow the noun in Manx but sometimes are prefixed to form a compound word.,,
"13. ‘shen yn oyr’, or ‘shen y fa’ that’s the reason or cause. Hence the dialect expression, ‘that’s the for.’",,
"14. Future tenses of irregular verbs are difficult to memorise, and among native speakers one often hears, ‘jean oo cheet?’ for ‘jig oo?’ etc. This use of the future of Jannoo is usually accepted in colloquial Manx. Similarly in the subjunctive, ‘cha jinnagh eh clashtyn rhym.’ (He would not hear me.)",,
17. Doonaght = Sabbath; preposition and the def. article before a noun generally cause mutation.,,
18. Notice the idiom·for ‘going to visit.’,,
21. ‘gur eh mie mooar eu’ = may there be great good at you. The Irish use ‘míle’ = a thousand thanks.,,

Notes on Lesson 9,,
"2. Verbs commencing with a vowel are preceeded by ‘g’ to form the verbal noun (infinitive). This is a relic of the Gaelic ‘aig’ (at). Note that the Manx idiom is to shout or call ‘on’, not ‘at’ or ‘to’ as in English. ‘Er y cheilley’ = literally, on his fellow.",,
5. ‘cho ... as’ equivalent to ‘as ... as’ in English.,,
7. When two vowels come together at the end of one and beginning of another word an ‘h’ is often inserted.,,
"8. In the Manx Bible the English word ‘back’ (adverb) is often found, although ‘er-ash’ gives the equivalent: ‘cheet er-ash = coming back, re-appearing.",,
"17. ‘cummal’ = holding, dwelling. Used either as noun or verbal noun.",,

“UP AND DOWN”,,
"The student is ofen confused by the use of so many words in Gaelic to express 'up ' and ' down,' so perhaps the following notes, table and examples will help to explain the occasions on which the various forms are to be used.",,
"First of all, everything must be considered from the position of the speaker, that is, immobile above or below him, going up from him or coming down towards him, or going down from him, or coming up towards him from below.",,
"The termination - EESE means 'down': - EOSE means 'up,' and the initial ‘H’ implies rest or immobility, while ‘S’ or ‘SH’ implies motion to some place or position away from the speaker and the initial ‘N’ signifies motion from some place towards the speaker.",,

"5. The prefix “aa” is equivalent to the Latin “re” = repetition, over again. “goan” is the plural of “goo” = Word, repute, fame, a saying.",,
"7. “seihll” = the world, and here means a person's lifetime in the world.",,
"9. “mraane,” the plural of “ben,” the r being strongly nasalised when spoken.",,

"12. ‘roayrt’ = the flood tide, hence a great flow of anything. Beef was a great luxury in the hard times of long ago.",,
"“uhllin,” = elbow, corner, bend. The meaning here is doubtful, but perhaps that death will keep away and hide as the mouse in the barn.[2]",,"[2] [uhllin] = elbow, corner, bend. The meaning here is doubtful, but perhaps that death will keep away and hide as the mouse in the barn.[2]
uhllin] ‘an enclosure beside a farmhouse in which crops are stored’. In Anglo-Manx Dialect ‘a haggard’, here evidently mistaken for [uillin] ‘an elbow’."
"16. If by chance a fair-haired person should be first to enter on New Year's Day, it was a bad omen, and all the misfortunes of the following year would be heaped on his head",,
"Do not confuse “cuirrit” and “currit.” The former is from “cuirrey” to bid, invite, to sow (as corn) or to shoot (as the herring nets); the latter is from “cur,” to give or put.",,
"17. “jough” means drink of any  kind, but as home-brewed ale was once the main drink. it has come to means ale or beer. “greim dy vee,” “greim” = a bite grip, hold, or stitch. “vee” is from “bee” = food, victuals.",,

Notes on Lesson 20,,
"1.  ‘coming in one’s meeting’. Note the possessive pronoun for each person; ‘... my whaiyl (meeting me) ‘ny whaiyl,’ (meeting him.) ‘... ny quaiy1, (meeting her.) and ‘... nyn guaiyl’ (meeting us you or them.) ",,
"2. ‘murrain,’ or ‘murran,’ a plague or contagious illness of any kind.",,
"4. ‘couyral,’ convalescing, improving. Is this from the English ‘re-covering’?",,
5. Note the preposition ‘da.’,,
"7. ‘taaue,’ = idle, indolent, still, quiet, motionless, etc.",,
"9. ‘ny sodjey,’ the comparative degree of ‘foddey,’ = longer, further.",,
"11. ‘te fo,’ = ’tis under him, he has a mind to, intends.",,
"12. When a question is asked without giving a definite verb and tense ‘cha nee’ may be used for ‘No,’ and ‘She,’ for ‘Yes.’",,
"13. ‘Shee’ = ‘Peace,’ but in this expression ‘shee’ is probably a corruption of Jee =  God. The Manx people were reluctant to use the name of the Holy One.",,
"19. ‘sonnys,’ = abunctance, plenty, good fortune, etc.; as opposed to ‘donnys’, = malady, disease, sickness, ill fortune.",,
"20. ‘er-chee’ = about to, having the intention of, aiming to.",,
21. Note the ‘my’ after ‘roish’. This appears to be peculiar to certain tenses when ‘before’ is used with a verb. Sometimes the ‘roish’ is omitted and only ‘my’ used to express ‘before.’,,
