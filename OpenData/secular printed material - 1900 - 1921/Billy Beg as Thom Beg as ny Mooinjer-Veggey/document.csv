"     Not far from Dalby, Billy beg and Tom beg, two hunchback cobblers, lived together on a lonely farm.",     Ta Billy beg as Thom beg daa ghreasee cruittagh va baghey cooidjagh ayns statehallooin ny lomarcan er-gerrey dys Delbee.,
"Billy beg was sharper and cleverer than Tom beg, who was always at his command.","Ya Billy beg ny s’tastee as ny s’croutee na Thom beg, as ren eh freayll eh fo e smaght. ",
"One day Billy beg gave Tom beg a staff, and quoth he :— ","Laa dy row hug Billy beg lorg da Thom beg, as dooyrt eh rish :",
"“Tom beg, go to the mountain and fetch home the white sheep.”","“Hom beg, gow magh dys y clieau as curlhiat yn cheyrrey vane thie.”",
"Tom beg took the staff and went to the mountain, but he could not find the white sheep.",Ghow Thom beg yn lorg ayns e laue as hie eh dys y clieau agh cha noddagh eh feddyn yn cheyrrey vane. ,
,,
"At last, when he was far from home, and dusk was coming on, he began to think that he had best go back.","Fy-yerrey, tra v'eh foddey voish y thie as keeiragh-ny-hoie cheet er, ren eh smooinaghtyn rish-hene bare da gholl thie. ",
"The night was fine, and stars and a small crescent moon were in the sky.","Va oie kiune ayn, as rollageyn as eayst corran keyl ayns yn aer. ",
No sound was to be heard but the curlew’s sharp whistle.,Cha row sheean ry-chlashtlyn agh feddanagh geyre y chrottag.,
"Tom was hastening home, and had almost reached Glen Rushen when a grey mist gathered and he lost his way.",Va Thom jannoo siyr dy gheddyn thie as v'eh bunnys ec Glion Rushen tra ren kay lheeah chymsagh as hie eh er shaghryn ass y chassan. ,
,,
"But it was not long before the mist cleared, and Tom beg found himself in a green glen such as he had never seen before, though he thought he knew every glen within five miles of him, for he was born and reared in the neighbourhood.","Agh ayns traa gerrid hrog yn kay seose as hooar Thom beg eh-hene ayns glion glass lheid as nagh naik eh rieau roie, ga heill eh dy row fys echey er dy-chooilley ghlion cheu-sthie jeh queig meeilaghyn, son v'eh ruggit as troggit ayns y naboonys.",
"He was marvelling, and wondering where he could be, when he heard a far-away sound drawing nearer to him.","V’eh goaill yindys mooar rish-hene cre'n voayl v'eh ayn, tra chluin eh feiyr foddey veih as myr tayrn ny sniessey da. ",
"“Ah,” said he to himself, “there are more than myself afoot on the mountains to-night; I shall have company.","“Aw,” dooyrt eh rish-hene, “Ta ny smoo na mee-hene er-y-chosh er ny sleityn noght. Yioyms sheshaght.”",
     The sound grew louder.,Ny syrjey as ny syrjey va’n feiyr gaase. ,
"First it was like the humming of bees, then like the rushing of Glen Meay waterfall, and last it was like the marching and the murmur of a crowd. It was the fairy host.","Hoshiaght cheayll eh myr dy beagh eh cronnane shellanyn eisht myr feiyr spooyt mooar ayns Glion Meay, as ec y jerrey myr sheean troailt ymmodee sleih. She’n cheshaght-chaggee mooinjer-veggey v’ayn. ",
"All of a sudden the glen was full of fine horses and of little people riding on them, with the lights on their red caps shining like the stars above and making the night as bright as day.","Chelleeragh va’n glion lung-lane jeh cabbil mooarey as jeh sleih veggey markiagh orroo, lesh soilshaghyn er nyn mayrnyn jiargey londyrnee myr whilleen rollageyn er-nynskyn as jannoo laa gial jeh'n oie.",
"There was the blowing of horns, the waving of flags, the playing of music, and the barking of many little dogs.","Va sheidey cayrnyn, as bennalt culleeyn, as kiaull bingys, as gounstyrnee ymmodee moddee veggey. ",
Tom beg thought that he had never seen anything so splendid as all he saw there.,Smooinee Thom beg rish hene cha naik eh rieau shilley ny s’aalin na honnick eh ayns-shoh. ,
"In the midst of the drilling and dancing and singing one of them spied Tom, and then Tom saw coming towards him the grandest little man he had ever set eyes upon, dressed in gold and silver, and silk shining like a raven’s wing.","Ayns mean nyn gloie-caggee as daunseeyn as kiaulleeaght hug fer jeu my-ner Thom, as eisht honnick Thom cheet ny whail yn dooinney beg s’ooasle hug eh rieau e hooillyn er, soit magh dy-stoamey lesh airh as argid, as lesh sheeidey soilshean myr skian y feeagh mooar.",
"“It is a bad time you have chosen to come this way,” said the little man, who was the king","“Te traa olk t’ou er reih dy heet yn raad shoh, dooyrt yn dooinney beg, v’eshyn ny ree. ",
"     ""Yes, but it is not here that I wish to be, said Tom. ","     “Cha mee ayns-shoh ta mee laccal dy ve,” dooyrt Thom. ",
"     Then said the king: “Are you one of us tonight, Tom?""","     Eisht dooyrt y ree, “Vel oo fer jin noght Thom ?” ",
"“I am surely,” said Tom.","     “Ta mish dy shickyr’s shen,” dooyrt Thom.",
"“Then,” said the king, “it will be your duty to take the pass word, you must stand at the foot of the glen, and as each regiment goes by you must take the pass word. It is, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.”","     “Eisht,” dooyrt y ree, “Bee eh yn currym ayd dy ghoaill fockle ny harrey[1] noght. Shegin dhyt shassoo ec cass ny glionney, as myr ta dy-chooilley heshaght goll shaghey, shegin dhyt goaill yn fockle ny harrey te Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean Jerdein, Jeheiney, Jesarn.""","[1] fockle ny harrey] a footnote by the author appears in the original newspaper article, it says; [By chance I came across the other day upon the true Manx term for “password”; fockle ny harrey.]"
"“I will do that with a heart and a half,” said Tom.","“Neem’s shen lesh cree dy lieh,” dooyrt Thom. ",
"     At daybreak the fiddlers took up their fiddles, the fairy army set itself in order, the fiddlers played before them out of the glen, and sweet that music was.","     Ec brishey yn laa ren ny kiaulleyderyn goaill seose nyn greinyn-kiaullee, hayrn seose yn cheshaght chaggee mooinjer-veggey ad-hene ayns strane-caggee, ren ny kiaulleyderyn cloie roue ass ny glionney, as cre cha millish va’n bingys shen ny lhieen ooilley’n aer. ",
"Each regiment gave the password to Tom as it went by, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,” and last of all came the king, and he too gave it, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.”","Ren dy chooilley heshaght cur yn fockle-ny harrey da Thom myr v’ad goll shaghey ass ny glionney — “Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean, Jerdein, Jeheiney, Jesarn ,” as lurg ooilley haink seose yn ree as myrgeddm hug eh eh da Thom—""Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean Jerdein, Jeheiney, Jesarn.”",
"Then he called in Manx to one of his men, “Take the hump from this fellow’s back,” and before the words were out of his mouth the hump was whisked off Tom Beg’s back and thrown into the hedge.","Eisht ren eh gyllagh er nane jeh’n deiney echey ayns Gailck. “Gow yn droyn jeh’n dreeym ec’er shoh,” as cha row yn fockle ny sleaie as beeal yn Ree dys va’n droyn skeabit jeh’n dreeym Thom as ceauit ayns y chleiy.",
"How proud now was Tom, who found himself the straightest man in the Isle of Man.","Cre cha moyrnagh as va Thom nish, son v’eh ieant yn dooinney s’jeeree ayns Ellan Vannin.",
He went down the mountain and came home early in the morning with light heart and eager step.,Hie eh neose jeh’n clieau as hooar eh thie dy leah ’sy voghrey lesh cree eddrym as kesmad chionn.,
"     Billy beg wondered greatly when he saw Tom beg so straight and strong, and when Tom beg had rested and refreshed himself he told his story, how he had met the fairies who came every night to Glen Rushen to drill.","Haink yindys mooar er Billy beg tra honnick eh Thom beg cha jeeragh as lager, as tra ren Tom beg goaill aash as greim-dy-vee dinsh eh da e skeeal voish bun as baare, cre’n aght ren eh meeiteil rish ny guillyn-beggey va cheet dy-chooilley hoie dys Glion Rushen cloie-caggee. ",
"The next night Billy beg set off along the mountain road, and came at last to the green glen.",’Syn oie er-giyn hie Billy beg roish er raad y clieau as haink eh fy-yerrey dys y glion glass. ,
"About midnight he heard the trampling of horses, the lashing of whips, the barking of dogs, and a great hullabaloo, and beheld the fairies and their king, their dogs and their horses at drill in the glen, as Tom beg had said. ","Mysh y mean-oie chluin eh stampey cabbil, yeealley chip, gounstyrnee moddee as feiyr gyn-tort as cur-my-ner yn mooinjer-veggey as nyn Ree, as nyn moddee as nyn gabbil ooilley ec cloie caggee myr dinsh Thom beg da. ",
"When they saw the humpback they all stopped, and one came forward and crossly asked his business.","Tra honnick ad yn dooinney cruitin duirree ad ooilley, as fer jeu haink ny whail as vrie eh gonnagh jeh cre’n elkin v’echey ayns-shoh ",
"     “I am one of yourselves for the night, and should be glad to do you some service,” said Billy beg.","     “Ta mish ’nane jiu-hene son noght as beem’s booiagh dy chooney lhieu,” dooyrt Billy beg.",
"So he was set to take the password, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.” and at daybreak the king said,","Myr shoh hug ad eh dy ghoaill yn fockle ny harrey “Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean, Jerdein, Jeheiney, Jesarn.”  As ec brishey yn laa dooyrt yn ree: ",
,,
     “It is time for us to be off.”,"     “Te traa dooin dy ve ersooyl,” ",
"     And up came regiment after regiment giving Billy beg the pass word, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday”  ","     eisht seose haink sheshaght lurg sheshaght cur da Billy beg yn fockle ny harrey myr v’ad goll shaghey — Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean, Jerdein, Jeheiney, Jesarn. ",
[2],"Lurg ooilley haink yn ree lesh e gheiney as hug eh yn fockle ny harrey myrgeddin — Jelhein, Jemayrt, Jecrean, Jerdein, Jeheiney,","[2] This sentence is missing in the English version in the newspaper. [After all came the king with his men and he gave the password too — Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,]"
"     “And Sunday,” says Billy beg, thinking himself clever.","“AS JYDOONEE,” dooyrt Billy beg smooinaghtyn dy row eh jannoo eh-hene mooar. ",
,,
     Then there was a great outcry. ,     Eisht va earn ard.,
"“Get the hump that was taken off that fellow's back last night and put it on this man's back,” cried the king, with flashing eyes, pointing to the hump that lay under the hedge.","“Fow yn droyn va goit jeh’n fer shen riyr as cur eh er dreeym yn fer shoh,” deie yn ree lesh sooillyn ard-lossey magh ass y kione echey lesh keoied, sheeyney magh e vair dys yn droyn ny lhie fo’n cleiy. ",
,,
"Before the words were well out of his mouth, the hump was clapt on to Billy beg’s back.",    Cha leah t’eh loayrt cha leah te jeant.,
"“Now,” said the king, “be off, and if ever I find you here again I[‘ll] clap another hump on to your front!”","“Nish,” dooyrt yn ree: “Gow royd, as my yioyms oo ayns-shoh reesht, neems cur droyn elley er y cheu-oai’s ayd !”",
"     And on that they all marched away with one great shout, and left poor Billy beg standing where they had found him, with a hump growing on to each shoulder.","As er shen dyllee ad ooilley lesh ardchoraa as jimmee ad roue, as daag ad Billy beg ny hassoo ayns y voayl hooar ad eh lesh droyn gaase er dagh geaylin.",
"And he came home next day, dragging one foot after the other, with a wizened face and as cross as two sticks, with his two humps on his back, and if they are not off they are there still.","As haink eh dy valley yn laa er-giyn sleadey cosh lorg cosh* lesh neeal grouw as cha crosh as tessin as daa vaidjey, lesh e ghaa droyn er e ghreeym, as managh vel ad jeh t’ad er foast.
