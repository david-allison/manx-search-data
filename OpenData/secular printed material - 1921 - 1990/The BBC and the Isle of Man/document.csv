"Cha vel Ellan Vannin ooilley cooidjagh jarroodit liorish yn B.B.C.; dy jarroo, cordail rish yn towse eck, t’ee shass magh dy vie ayns ny immeeaghtyn bleeaney.","The Isle of Man is not altogether forgotten by the B.B.C.; indeed, in proportion to its size, it stands out well in the yearly programmes.",

"     Agh cha vel monney tastey er ny ve goaill jeh yn Glare Gailckagh; as ayns raadyn elley myrgeddin, cha vel yn cheu Bea Ellanagh foast er ny ve hoilshaghey ayns immeeaghtyn radio dy slane firrinagh gys Ellan Vannin.",     But not much notice has been taken of the Manx language; and in other ways also the side of island life which has hitherto appeared in radio programmes has not been wholly true to the Isle of Man.,
"     Ta ny “T.T. races” ernyve choyrt ard-ynnyd, agh t’ad foddey smoo chooish jeh joarreyn na chooish Manninagh.","     The “T.T. races” have been given prominence, but they are far more an affair of strangers than a Manx affair.",

Cre’n Fa Nagh Paart Jeh Gailck Manninagh Ayns Ny Kaartyn-Jannoo Ain?,WHY NOT MANX GAELIC IN OUR PROGRAMMES?,
     She cheet dy ve kinjagh smoo ny s’cronnal dy vel yn jannoo-mie ny daailid jeh’n eab dy mooar er yn cruinid ny red-elley jeh yn bennid echey lesh ny gleashaghtyn-glaragh ayns ny cheeraghyn Ghailckagh elley.,     Is is becoming ever more apparent that the succes or failure of the attempt to preserve and revive the Manx language depends very largely upon the closeness or otherwise of its connection with the language movements in the other Gaelic countries.,
"Cha vod thalloo jeh agh ynrican 50,000 theay (as agh paart ny sloo jeh shen loayrt yn Ghailck) gow treisht dy chosney yn caggey jeh yn ghalre ooilley cooidjagh ny lomarcan, Ta’n Ghailck Yernagh, yn Ghailck Albanagh as yn Ghailck Manninagh ooilley nane glare, as veagh ny gleashaghyn-glaragh ayns ooilley tree cheeragheyn jannoo dy mie dy chur doccar-coraa er yn irrinys shoh;","A land of only 50,000 inhabitants (and a very small proportion of those speaking the Gaelic) cannot hope to win its language battle quite alone. Irish, Scottish and Manx Gaelic are all one tongue, and the language movements in all three countries would do well to emphasise this truth;",
"agh ta’n Ghailck manninagh lowit dy ve banglane trome-cooishagh jeh Ghailck; as shen-y-fa shegin j’ee foays da studeyryn jeh yn Ghailck myr slane, as myrgeddin cooney ga’n ghleashey-glaragh dy Vannin, my vod paart jeh ny Kaartyn-jannoo Ghailckagh, ny ayns paart Ghailckagh, cur stiagh keayrt-ny-Ghaa beggan jeh arraneys as loayrtys Manninagh.","But Manx is allowed to be an important Gaelic dialect, and, therefore, it should be of interest to students of Gaelic in general, and also a help to the Manx language movement, if some of the Gaelic or partly Gaelic programmes could occasionally include examples of Manx singing and speech.",
