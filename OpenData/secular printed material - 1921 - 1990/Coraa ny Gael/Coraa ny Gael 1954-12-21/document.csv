","The Chairman of the Douglas Commissioners was present (at) THE CHRISTMAS PARTY at the Pulrose School, and the children did well, but there was one thing better than anything else there, that was the way that they gave out the Carval “While the Shepherds were” in Manx, and Charles Clark said that there was no information that they were about to do such a thing, because he didn’t hear them practicing in Manx, and he was delighted to hear them.
