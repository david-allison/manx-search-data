"Er my hon hene, cha nel mee shirrey dy chur er pyagh na sleih erbee dy smooiniaghtyn dy vel ny oltyn jeh’n Kiare As Feed, ny oltyn jeh “Board” erbee jannoo veg, agh by vie lhiam mooar fakin er aght erbee caa currit da nyn ’leih aeg dy fuirraghtyn ayns Mannin, as cur jerrey er nyn stayd caddlee.","As for myself, I am not looking to make any person or people to think that the members of the Keys, or members of any “Board” are doing anything, but I would be very glad to see in any way an opportunity given to the young people to stay in the Isle of Man, and put an end to their state of sleep.",
"Hie Doug as mee hene ersooyl Jemayrt shoh chaie, as ga dy row turrys agglagh ain as sterrymagh ass cwestian, cha row shin ching er cor erbee, as cha row veg agh[1] Gaelg goll er loayrt eddyr ain, ny eddyr mish as tilgey!","Doug and myself went away last Tuesday, and although we had an awful trip and stormy ‘beyond question’, we weren’t sick at all, and there was only Manx being spoken between us, or between me and vomiting!",[1] agh] original gives [as]

"’Streih lhiam gra, ta dy chooilley nhee cheet gy kione, as Jerdein, v’eh orrin dy heet noal dy Vannin, agh cha row shen jerrey er y Gaelg, son va traa feer vie ain reeshtagh.","I’m sorry to say everything comes to an end, and on Thursday, we had to come back to the Isle of Man, but that wasn’t an end for the Manx, because we had a very good time yet again.",
Nagh nee red yindyssagh dy lhie sheese er battey jannoo veg agh loayrt ass nyn jengey ain.,Isn’t it a wonderful thing to lie down on a boat doing nothing but speaking in our language.,
