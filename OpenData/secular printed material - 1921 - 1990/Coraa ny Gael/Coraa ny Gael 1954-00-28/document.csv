CORAA NY GAEL,Voice of the Gaels,
Va baatey ’g eeastagh ass Purt ny h-Inshey Jedoonee as skimmee Gaelgagh urree.,There was a boat fishing out of Peel on Sunday with a Manx (language) crew aboard.,
Cha dayr shin monney — she sheshaght moal erskyn towse v’ayn.,We didn’t catch much — it was an incredibly poor crew. ,
"Va Eric Cregeen er-chee cheet marin, agh myr fer creeney cha daink eh.","Eric Cregeen was about to come with us, but as a wiseman, he didn’t come.",
"Ny lurg y eeastagh, hug y Kione Jiarg, Illiam y Radlagh, y Breagagh as mish, shilley er y baatey “Hesperus” ny lhie sy phurt ec Rumsaa.","After the fishing, Kione Jiarg, Bill Radcliffe, the Breagagh and I, visited the boat “Hesperus” lying in the harbour at Ramsey.",
"Ta’n “Hesperus” goll mygeart er ny thieyn-sollys ayns ’n Albin as Mannin, as ta Gaelg Albinagh ec y chooid smoo jeh’n skimee.","The “Hesperus” is going around the light-houses in Scotland and the Isle of Man, and most of the crew know Scottish Gaelic.",
"She daa oor mie v’ain taggloo ry-cheilley ass Gaelg, ny Albinee as shinyn goaill yindys ec yn caslys eddyr y daa ghlare.","It was two good hours that we had talking together in Gaelic, the Scottish and us being surprised at the comparison between the two languages.",
Myr dooyrt fer ass ny Albinee; “Ta shin jannoo ram caarjyn trooid Gaelg.”,As one of the Scots said; “We make many friends through Gaelic.”,
"Dy jarroo, va ny Manninee bunnys tannaght er y baatey, cho yindyssagh as ta’n Ghaeltaght ghleashagh shoh. ","Indeed, the Manx were nearly staying on the boat, so wonderful was this moving Gaeltacht.",
,,
"Aghterbee, heemayd y “Hesperus” ec Mee y Nollick reesht; cre mysh cummal ceili urree?","Anyway, we will see the “Hesperus” in December again; how about holding a ceili aboard it?",
Caarjyn elley ren shin trooid Gaelg va daa Yernagh aegey va goaill laghyn seyrey ayns shoh shiaghtyn chaie — nane jeu ny ’er-ynsee as y fer elley ny ghrosaer.,Other friends we made through Manx were two young Irish men who were on holiday here last week — one of them a teacher and the other a grocer. ,
"Cha row ’s oc dy row Gaelg rieau ayn er nyn ellan, as v’ad jeant magh dy chlashtyn ee.","They didn’t know that Manx ever existed in the Isle of man, and they were satisfied (delighted) to hear it.",
"Cha row y fer-ynsee jannoo ram jeh’n aght ta yernish goll er ynsagh; “Ta’d prowal [d]y hyndaa y clag er-ash,” as eshyn.","The teacher wasn’t impressed with the way Irish is being taught, “they are trying to turn the clock back,” he said.",
"Ta ny scollagyn ’g ynsagh Yernish dy gheddyn obbyr, as eisht ta’d ceau ee ersooyl.","The teenagers learn irish to get work, and then they throw it away.",
S’mian lesh[1] y Yernagh shoh kiangley seose Yernish lesh gagh nhee noa.,This Irishman wants to connect up Irish with every new thing.,"[1] S’mian lesh] a calque on Irish [is mian leis] ‘he wants to’, see also Scottish Gaelic [is mhiann leis]."
"“Ta shin ayns feme jeh coardailys roosyn nagh vel dy-slane son ’n Erin,” dooyrt eh, “er-nonney bee nyn jeer scoltit eddyr ny Gaelgee aileagh as ny Baarlee. Shegin dooin ve shleeuit y chur Gaelg er ny Baarlee.”","“We need agreement with those who are not completely in favour of Ireland,” he said, “otherwise our country will be split between the firey Irish speakers and the English speakers. We must be keen to ‘put Irish on the English speakers.”",
"S'feer shen. Son shickyrys, bee fys ec ny paitchyn ayns brastyl yn ’er-ynsee shoh dy vel Gaelg ayn foast ayns Mannin !","How true that is. Certainly, the the children in this teacher’s class will know that Manx exists still in the Isle of Man!",
