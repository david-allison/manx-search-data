Hooar Bnr. Emily Cooke (Emily Quirk) baase oie jecrein shoh chaie. ,Mrs. Emily Cooke (Emily Quirk) died last Wednesday night.,
"V’ee ruggit ayns Purt Ny h-Inshey, as ren ee poosey rish yn Arrymagh Illiam Cooke dy row eh-hene ruggit er yn ellan. ","She was born in Peel, and married the Reverend William Cooke who was himself born on the island.",
"V’ad nyn neesht jeu feer ghraihagh er yn ellan, as er dy chooilley nhee Ceiltiagh.","They were both very fond of the island, and everything Celtic.",
"Va lane fys ec e sheshey er nyn jengey, as shimmey keeayrt t’eh er hoie sheese roish chiollagh Harry Kelly, geashtiagh rish skeealyn mychione shenn laaghyn. ","Her husband knew our language very well, and many’s the time he has sat down befoe the Harry Kelly’s hearth, listening to stories about the old days.",
"Nish, ta’n Gaelg er choayl daa charrey mie.","Now, Manx has lost two good friends.",
"Va Bnr. Cooke bunnys 92 vlein dy eash. T’ee er ve beaghey ayns Soystyn rish tammylt, as bee yn carbyd goll dy jeeragh veih’n baatey lesh y Rullick Baljey Dooilish, raad vees sherveish veg sy Cheeil ny Ruilickey.","Mrs. Cooke was almost 92 years old. She has been living in England for a while, and the hearse will be going straight from the boat towards Douglas Town Cemetery, where there will be a little service in the Cemetery Church.",
"     Cha bee eh feer foddey nish derrey vees ram joaree cheet hug nyn ellan ain, as ny vud oc vees ram Yernee, Albinee, as Vretnee. Er my hon hene,  s’cummey dou ad shen ass Soystyn, lhig dauesyn cheet ny dyn, agh reeshtagh, ta mee gra, lhig dooin shirrey magh “Adsyn Ceiltiagh,” as cur orroo toiggal dy vel foast Gaelg goll er loayrt ayns shoh as nagh vel shinnyn caillit da “Celitia”. ","     It won’t be very long now until there will be many foreigners coming to our island, and amongst them there will be many Irish, Scottish and Welsh people. As for my self, those from England don’t matter to me, let them come or not, but yet again, I say, let us seek out “Those who are Celtic”, and make them understand that Manx is still being spoken here and that we aren’t lost to “Celitia”",
"     Myr ta mee my hoie ayns shoh screeu, as ny keayrtyn jeeaghyn trooid yn unniag: s’aalin yn laa eh, grianagh as kiune myr lhisagh eh ve s’yn imbagh shoh.","     As I am sat here writing, and sometimes looking through the window: how beautiful the day is, sunny and calm as it ought to be in this season.",
Te cur orrym dy smooiniaght mychione ny laaghyn t’er ny gholl shaghey. ,It makes me think about the bygone days.,
"Shimmey dooinney as ben mie t’er n’oll shaghey yn thie shoh er y yurnaa s’jerree hug y rullick, as s'tiark ta er mayrn nish goll roosyn.","Many’s the man and good woman who have gone past this house on their final journey to the graveyard, and how few are left now like them.",
"Agh ny yeih, foddee ren adsyn smooiniaghtyn s’yn aght cheddin, foddee veagh adsyn er ghra roo-hene myr v’ad fakin nyn shenn ayraghyn goll ersooyl thie hug y rullick: “S’tiark ta er mayrn goll roosyn.”","But, nevertheless, maybe they thought in the same way, maybe they would have said to themselves as they saw their old parents going away home to the graveyard “how few are left now like them.”",
"Nagh nee currym orrin dy yannoo nyn gooid share dy reeayl bio yn Aght-Baghee[1] v’oc, as foddee hig[2] mayd dy ve buinnys cho mie as adsyn. ","Do we not have a responibility to do our best to keep alive their old Way of Life, and maybe we will become almost as good as them.","[1] Aght-Baghee] original gives [Aght-Beaghe].

"Hoshiaght, lhig dooin cooney y yannoo[3] eddyr ain hene lesh nyn gredue. as nyn jengey, as foddee, Lesh Cooney Yee hig sheelogh noa feeu dy ve bio er yn “Ellan Sheeant Shoh.”","First, let’s help between ourselves with our faith, and then language, and maybe, With God’s Help, a new worthy generation will come to be alive on this “Blessed Island.”","[3] [y yannoo] ‘to do’ superfluous here, likely left in in error."
