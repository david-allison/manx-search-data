Manx,English,Notes
Va paart jeh ny eeasteyryn feer chione-lajeragh.,Some of the fishermen were very headstrong.,
"Va mish shiaulley marish mainshter keayrt dy row as va daa ghooinney jeh’n cheshaght er yn un laue, as va’n mainshter goaill yn choyrle oc ayns dy chooilley red, as v’ad myr ny Ishmaeliteyn: veagh ad noi dy chooilley red veagh ny deiney elley laccal jannoo as cha row ad feer tushtagh veg smoo na deiney elley. ","I was sailing with a skipper one time and there were two men of the crew on the one hand, and the  master took their advice in every matter, and they were like the Ishmaelites: they would be against everything the other men wanted to do and they were not very intelligent any more than other men.",
"¶ Ren shin cuirr yn lieen un fastyr aalin as kiune, agh va’n aer jeeaghyn quaagh, ginsh dy row geay as fliaghey er-gerrey.","¶ We cast the net one fine, calm evening, but the sky looked strange, indicating that wind and rain were near. ",
"Tra va’n oie er jeet, ren shin prowal yn lieen as va tree cheead ayns yn piyr, as ren shin ceau ee ayn reesht dy lhiggey daue thooilley.","When the night had come, we proved the net and there were three hundred in the pair, and we threw it in again to let them flood.",
"Kione tammylt dy hraa ren shin prowal reesht as hug shin mysh meaish assjee, as ren shin ceau ee ayn reesht.","After a while we proved again and we got about a measure out of it, and we cast it in again.",
"Ren shin prowal ayns traa gerrid as v’ee lane reesht, as va’n lieen ny lhie er yn ghrunt lane scaddan.","We proved after a short time and it was full again, and the net was lying on the bottom full of herring.",
"¶ Dooyrt mee hene roo dy row eh traa dooin cur er boayrd, agh dooyrt yn daa ghooinney shoh dy row eh traa dy liooar.","¶ I myself said to them that it was time for us to haul on board, but these two men said that there was plenty of time.",
"Va’n gheay goaill niart as va bwoaillee [MS bwilley] er yn eayst, as v’eh traa dooin cur er boayrd, mannagh row veg dy scaddan aynjee.","The wind was picking up and there was a halo on the moon, and it was time for us to haul on board, if there were no herring in the net.",
"Va mee brasnagh ad dy chur er boayrd; ooilley yn traa va’n mainshter er ve booiagh dy liooar dy chur er boayrd, agh cha jinnagh eh gra veg noi’n daa ghooinney shoh. ","I was urging them to haul aboard; all the time the master had been happy enough to haul aboard, but he would not say anything against these two men.",
Ec yn jerrey ren fer jeu briaght jeem nee agglagh va mee dy beagh rour aynjee.,At last one of them asked me if I was afraid there was too much in the net.,
"¶ “She,” dooyrt mee. ","¶ “Yes,” I said.",
"¶ “Cha ren mee rieau fakin rour foast,” dooyrt eh. ","¶ “I haven’t seen too much yet,” he said.",
"¶ As ec yn jerrey ren yn mainshter goaill my choyrle, as ghow shin toshiaght dy chur er boayrd, as va wheesh dy scaddan aynjee, nagh row shin abyl geddyn ee er boayrd. ","¶ In the end the master took my advice, and we began to haul on board, and there was so much herring in the net, that we were not able to get it on board.",
"Hooar shin paart jee goit er boayrd, as dooyrt fer jeh ny deiney shoh, “Vel saase erbee dy gheddyn yn scaddan ass dy cheau ayn ee tammylt elley?” ","We got some of it taken on board, and one of these said, “Is there any way of getting the herring out to cast the net in for another while?”",
Agh dooyrt yn mainshter dy row ee ayn foddey dy liooar. ,But the master said it was in long enough.,
"Myr shen va shin tayrn ee er boayrd cha tappee as oddagh shin, as ren yn lieen cheet seose gys mullagh yn ushtey as v’eh lane scaddan.","So we hauled it on board as fast as we could, and the net came up to the surface of the water and it was full of herring.",
Cha row veg ry akin agh scaddan.,There was nothing to be seen but herring.,
"¶ Tra hooar shin kiare ny queig dy pheeshyn stiagh, haink baatey-shiaullee goll er son yn purt as ren ee goll trooid yn lieen ain as brishey eh. ","¶ When we got four or five pieces in, a sailing boat came on its way to the harbour and it went through our net and broke it. ",
,,
"Myr shen cha dooar shin arragh, agh va’n gheay sheidey dy tappee. ","So we did not get any more, but the wind was blowing fast.",
Ren shin cur yn croan er mullagh y ching as troggal shiaull agh ren yn baatey cur y jerrey fo’n ushtey daa cheayrt.,We frantically set the mast up and raised the sail but the boat put its bow under the water twice.,
"Jus v’ee aarloo dy gholl sheese, agh ren yn mainshter cummal ee roish yn gheay as roie stiagh lesh yn traie son dy hauail nyn mioys.","She was just about ready to sink, but the master held her before the wind and ran in towards the shore to save our lives.",
"Agh roish ren shin roshtyn yn traie hooar shin yn ushtey currit magh, as va shin cur magh ushtey ooilley yn raad gys yn purt.","But before we reached the shore, we got the water bailed out, and we were bailing water all the way to the harbour.",
¶ Hooar shin stiagh ayns purt Howth ayns Nerin ec brishey yn laa moghrey Jesarn as va daa ayrn jeh’n lieen ain caillit.,"¶ We got into Howth harbour in Ireland at daybreak on Saturday morning, and two thirds of our net were lost.",
Va mysh keead meaish dy scaddan ain.,We had about a hundred measures of herring.,
"Haink lheid yn sterrym gys nagh dooar shin yn scaddan assjee gys yn oie laa-ny-vairagh, va wheesh dy scaddan ayns yn lieen ain as va er lughtagh three baatyn dy beagh shin er chur er boayrd ayns traa.","Such a storm came that we did not get the herring out of the net until the night of the following day, there would have been as much herring in our net as would have loaded three boats if we had hauled on board in time.",
"Va palchey scaddan er ve ain as yn lieen neesht agh cha jinnagh ad goaill coyrle, as va ny smoo dy choayl ain na v’ain dy chosney.","We would have had plenty of herring and the net as well, but they would not take advice, and we had more loss than gain.",
Myr shen ta shin fakin nagh vel eh mie dy ve sayntoilagh.,So we see that it is not good to be covetous.,
¶ Ta mee er ve marish deiney as v’ad er choyrt wheesh dy scaddan ayns baatey gys v’ee er gholl sheese.,¶ I have been with men and they would have hauled so much herring into a boat that she would have gone down.,
,,
"Honnick mee unnane goll sheese un voghrey as cha row monney geay ayn, agh ren ad cur wheesh dy scaddan er boayrd gys ren yn keayn cheet aynjee as cha voddagh ad geddyn eh assjee.","I saw one going down one morning and there was not much wind, but they took so much herring on board that the sea came into her and they could not get it out of her.",
Myr shen ren ad ooilley goll ayns yn baatey beg as hie ee sheese ayns traa feer gherrid ny lurg shen.,So they all got into the small boat and she went down very short while after that.,
"Parick Noo voish Purt ny Hinshey va’n ennym eck as va keayn ooilagh goll sheear lesh yn Cholloo son shiaght ny hoght dy hiaghteeyn ny lurg shen, as cha vel thammag dy scaddan er jeet er yn choorse shen rieau er dy henney, boayl va shin cliaghtey geddyn eeasteeyn mie.","St. Patrick from Peel was her name and there was an oily sea going west towards the Calf for seven or eight weeks after that, and no bush of herring has come on that course ever since, where we used to get good catches.",
"Ta mee er ve marish deiney as myr veagh shin shiaulley ayns yn oie dy akin scaddan ayns yn ushtey, tra veagh shin cheet ayns thammag, veagh ad goll er finnue as roie mygeayrt gollrish reddyn keoi.","I have been with men and as we would be sailing at night to see herring in the water, when we would come on a bush, they would be going furiously and running about like mad things.",
Ta mee er vakin shin coayl lesh ve ayns rour siyr as keayrtyn lesh rour lhiggey shaghey.,I have seen us losing by being in too much haste and sometimes by too much delay.,
T’eh yn aght share goaill ny reddyn ayns yn aght meanagh gyn rour siyr ny rour lhiggey shaghey.,It is best to take things in the middle way without too much haste or too much delay.,
"¶ Ren mee fakin ayns pabyr dy ren shiu geddyn er feer vie lesh yn Ghaelg ec Doolish, as ta mee jerkal dy jean ny Manninee streeu dy gheddyn chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin seose reesht.","¶ I read in a paper that you got on very well with the Manx at Douglas, and I hope that the Manx will strive to get the mother tongue of the Isle of Man up again.",
T’eh jeeaghyn dou dy vel yn sleih mygeayrt yn Owe goaill paart dy haitnys ayns yn Ghaelg.,It seems to me that the people around the Howe take some pleasure in Manx.,
"Va fer jeh ny deiney haink ayns yn steamer riyr ginsh dou dy row eh er chur lesh lioar dy arraneyn spyrrydoil Gaelgagh marish, as v’eh streeu dy lhaih ee.","One of the men who came in the steamer last night was telling me that he had brought a book of Manx hymns with him, and he was striving to read it.",
Dy jinnagh ooilley ny Manninee goaill taitnys ayns lhaih Gaelg yinnagh ad jannoo dy mie.,If all the Manx took pleasure in reading Manx they would do well.,
