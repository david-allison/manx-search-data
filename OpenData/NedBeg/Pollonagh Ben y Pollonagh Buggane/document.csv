"Veagh ny shenn eeasteyryn fakin eh dy mennick ayns yn traa t’er gholl shaghey, as veagh ad ceau braghtan dy arran corkey as eeym er huggey, kied echey v’eh gee eh ny dyn.","The old fishermen would often see him in the past, and they would throw a piece of buttered oatbread to him, whether he ate it or not.",

","Another old man was telling me that he and his two sisters saw the mermaid at Cass Strooan sitting on a rock, and she had very big breasts.",

Agh ayns laghyn yn vea ain t’ad ersooyl gollrish ny ferrishyn.,But in our lifetime they have all gone like the fairies.,
"Cha vel unnane fakin ad ec traa erbee, as ta’n pollonagh neesht er immeeaght marish ooilley ny bugganeyn elley.","No one sees them at any time, and the merman has also departed together with all the other bugganes.",
Va buggane goaill ayns towl t’ayns yn Chione Doo.,A buggane was living in a hole in Kione Doo.,

",
"Cha vel yn towl jeeaghyn agh myr scoltey ayns yn eaynin, as ta mish er ve ayns yn towl daa cheayrt.","The hole just appears like a cleft in the cliff, and I have been in the hole twice.",

"Va’n sleih cliaghtey gra dy re dunverys v’er ve jeant ayn, as dy jarroo t’eh gollrish dy beagh lane saagh dy fuill er duittym er ny claghyn baney t’ayns yn laare. ","The people used to say that a murder had been committed there, and indeed it is like as if a vesselful of blood had fallen on the white stones in the floor.",
