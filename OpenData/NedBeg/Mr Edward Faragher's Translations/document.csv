,"Dear Sir, ",,
,"               I received your letter and I am very much obliged for the Manx Hymns. I have seen them when I was young, but they have been forgotten. Mr Roeder, in Manchester, has the other part of the Fables, and I don’t know whether they will be printed or not, and I don't care either, for fame will do me little good, since I must soon go to the house for all living whence none return. ",,
,"     I remain, dear sir, ",,
,"                       Sincerely yours, ",,
