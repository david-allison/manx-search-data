"Ta mee er chlashtyn ad ginsh mychione saggyrt va cummal er gerrey da’n ruillick, as va mac echey va lheamysit, as cha row eh son shooyl agh feer veg.","I have heard them tell about a priest who was living near to the graveyard, and he had a son who was disabled, and he could only walk a very little.","Ta mee er clashgyn ad gynsh mychione saggyrt va commal ergherrey da yn rellick, as va mac eck eh va lhemysit, as cha row eh son shooyl agh feer veg",
"     Va un oie ayns yn gheurey; as va’d ginsh mysh scaa va cheet ass yn ruillick ayns yn oie, as va’d ooilley er creau as feer agglagh roish.","     There was one night in the winter; and they were telling about a ghost that was coming from the graveyard at night, and they were all shaking and very afraid of it.","va un oie ayns yn geurey; as va’d ginsh mysh scaa, va cheet as yn rellick ayns yn oie, as va’d ooilley er craue as feer aglagh roish,",
"     Dooyrt yn fer croobagh rish yn fer mooinjer, my yinnagh eh cur lesh eshyn er e ghreem magh ayns yn ruillick, dy jinnagh eh loayrt rish yn scaa.","     The cripple said to the man-servant[1], if he would bring him on his back out in the graveyard, that he would talk to the ghost.","dooyrt yn fer crubagh rish yn fer mooinjer, my yinnagh eh cur lesh eshyn er y ghreem magh ayns yn rellick, dy jeanagh eh loayrt rish yn scaa.","[1] fer-mooinjer] Cregeen gives ‘man-servant’, in 20th Century Manx it is often used for ‘relative’."
"    Dooyrt yn fer mooinjer rish dy jinnagh eh cur lesh eh trooid yn ruillick traa erbee dy baillish goll. Myr shen, tra va mean oie er jeet, dooyrt yn fer croobagh dy row eh traa da goll. Eisht gow yn fer mooinjer eh er e ghreeym, as hie ad stiagh er giat ny ruillickey;","     The man-servant said to him that he would bring him through the graveyard any time that he wished to go. So, when midnight had come, the cripple said that it was time for him to go. Then the man-servant got him on his back, and they went in through the gate of the graveyard.","Dooyrt yn fer mooinjer rish dy jeannagh eh cur lesh eh trooid yn rellick tra erbee dy ballyish gholl. mor shen tra va meanoie er jeet, dooyrt yn fer crubagh dy row e tra da gholl, esht gow yn fer mooinjer eh er y ghreem, as hie ad stiagh er gaat ny relkey;",
"     Veagh yn saggyrt freayl paart dy chirree ayns yn ruillick, myr va saggyrtyn cliaghtey jannoo, as yn oie shen va daa vaarlagh ayns yn ruillick mysh geid kerrey, as tra haink yn fer mooinjer stiagh as yn fer croobagh er e ghreeym, honnick fer jeh ny maarlee eh; as smooinaght dy re e chomraag v’ayn, as kerrey echey er e ghreeym, haink eh er gerrey as dooyrt eh,        ","     They priest would keep some sheep in the graveyard, as priests used to do, and that night there were two thieves in the graveyard about to steal a sheep, and the man-servant came in with the cripple on his back, one of the thieves saw him; and thinking that it was his companion, with a sheep on his back, he came up to him and he said,","Vagh yn saggyrt freeayl paart dy kerree ayns yn rellick, mor va saggyrtyn chliaghtey jannoo; As yn oie shen va daa vaarlagh ayns yn rellick mysh gheid kerrey, as tra haink yn fer mooinjer stiagh as yn fer crubagh er y ghreem, honnick fer jeh ny maarlee eh; as smooinniagh dy re y comraag va ayn, as kerrey ec eh er y ghreem, haink eh ergerrey as dooyrt eh vel ee rouyr, boy? vel ee rouyr?",
"     “Vel ee rouyr, boy? Vel ee rouyr?”","     “Is it fat, boy? Is it fat?”",,
"     “Rouyr ny boght ee, gow ee myr t’ee!” dooyrt yn fer mooinjer, as cheau eh yn fer crubagh huggey, as roie eh dy gheddyn stiagh ayns thie yn saggyrt. Agh tra ren yn fer mooinjer geddyn stiagh, va’n fer croobagh sthie hoshiaght, as te feer lickly dy row eh son shooyl dy mie ny lurg shen.","     “[Be it] Fat or poor, take it as it is!” said the man-servant, and he threw the cripple to him, and he ran to get into the priest’s house. But when the man-servant got in, the cripple was inside first, and it’s highly likely that he was able to walk well after that.","Rouyr ny boght ee, gow ee mor t’ee, dooyrt yn fer mooinjer, as cheau eh yn fer crubagh hug eh, as roie e dy gheddyn stiagh ayns thie yn saggyrt, agh tra ren yn fer mooinjer gheddyn stiagh va’n fer crubagh stie hoshaght, as te feer lickly dy row eh son shooyl dy mie ny lurg shen.",
