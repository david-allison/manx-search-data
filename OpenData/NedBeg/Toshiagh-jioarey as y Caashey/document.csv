Manx,English,Notes
Ta mish er chlashtyn Boy Ruy Willy Kency ginsh mygeayrt sloop veg va currit er ny creggyn ec yn Traie Vane. ,I have heard Boy Ruy Willy Kency tell about a small sloop that ran aground on the rocks at Traie Vane. ,
"V’ee lughtit dy chaashey, as va ooilley yn sleih tayrn caashey gys ny thieyn oc hene as follagh eh gys va slane lught yn sloop ersooyl, paart ersooyl lesh yn cheayn, as yn chooid elley currit lesh ec yn sleih mygeayrt, as paart jeu voish skeeraghyn elley.","She was loaded with cheese, and all the people were dragging cheese to their own houses and hiding it until the whole cargo of the sloop was gone, some washed away by the sea, and the rest taken by the people around about, and some from other parishes. ",
Myr shen va’n caashey ooilley goit.,So the cheese was all taken.,
¶ Ny lurg shen ren mainshter yn sloop goaill ass laue dy choyrt bing orroo dy voddagh eh geddyn magh quoi ren geid yn caashey. ,¶ Afterwards the master of the sloop undertook to take them to court so he could find out who stole the cheese. ,
"Va ymmodee sleih sumnit gys yn ving, as va turneyr ny jees ayn marish y toshiagh-jioarey.","Many people were summoned to jury, and there was an advocate or two together with the coroner.",
"Cha row veg jeh ny turneyryn ny deiney-bingey toiggal Gaelg, agh va’n toshiagh-jioarey son loayrt ee dy mie.","None of the advocates or the jurymen could understand Manx, but the coroner could speak it well. ",
As va eshyn reiht dy phrowal ny deiney.,And he was chosen to try the men.,
"¶ Myr shen v’eh gyllagh ad fer lurg fer cordail rish nyn ennym, as myr v’ad cheet gys yn lioar, v’eh gra roo eh hene, “Va paart euish jeh, as va paart aym’s jeh, as cha row unnane jin follym.” ","¶ So he called them one by one according to their names, and as they came up to the book, he said to them himself, “You had some of it, and I had some of it, and none of us were empty-handed.” ",
V’eh gra shoh roo ayns Gaelg.,He said this to them in Manx. ,
"¶ Eisht v’eh gra roo ayns Baarle, “Kiss the book ye dog ye, pack away ye rogue ye.” ","¶ Then he said to them in English, “Kiss the Book ye dog ye, pack away ye rogue ye.”",
¶ Myr shen cha row dooinney erbee eginit dy ghoaill y loo liorish keeayll yn toshiagh-jioarey. ,¶ So no one was compelled to take the oath by the good sense of the coroner. ,
V’ad ooilley er ny heyrey as cha row unnane goit dy ve maarlee.,They were all acquitted and there no-one was taken to be thieves.,
Ren yn Ghaelg prowal feer vie ec yn traa shen dy follagh ny maarlee.,The Manx proved very satisfactorily at that time to conceal the thieves.,
Agh ayns ny laghyn t’ayn nish cha vel toshiagh-jioarey hene son taggloo Gaelg dy heyrey ny kyndee as dy hauail ny maarlee.,But nowadays there is not a single coroner able to speak Manx to acquit the guilty and to save the thieves.,
"V’eh jeeaghyn dy row yn toshiagh-jioarey shen son geid caashey marish yn chooid elley jeh’n sleih, as ren eh geddyn magh yn crout shen son dy hauail eh hene marish yn sleih elley.","It appeared that that coroner wanted to steal cheese along with the rest of the people, and he worked out that trick to save himself along with the others.",
¶ Ta paart dy sleih feer chroutagh er ve ayns yn seihll roish nish. ,¶ There have been some very wily people in the world before now.,
Ny-yeih ta mish smooinaght dy vel ny shlee mitchoor ayns yn seihll ec y traa t’ayn na va rieau ayn roie.,Nevertheless I think there are fewer rogues in the world at present than there ever were before.,
Ta’n sleih geddyn lane ynsagh nish.,People get a lot of education now. ,
Ny-yeih cha vel ad monney share ayns nyn mea. ,Nevertheless they are not much better in their lives.,
"Va ymmodee jeh’n chenn sleih feer oney, as va paart dy gheiney ayn rish my vea hene nagh jinnagh assee da lhiannoo.","Many of the old people were very innocent, and there were some  men in my own lifetime who would not harm a child.",
