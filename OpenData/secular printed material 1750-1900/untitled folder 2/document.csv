As jerkal t’ain rish queig cheead foast,And expecting still five hundred,
Voish naboo Hostyn[12] cour yn chooish:,From our English neighbours for the cause.,[12] naboo Hostyn] — ‘neighbour of England’ this might be a case of non-standard lenition (as seen elsewhere in this piece with ‘hirveish’ used where ‘shirveish’ would be expected) as ‘naboo Sostyn’ – ‘neighbour England’ fits better.

Ny bioee ooilley cherraghtyn.,The living would all suddenly perish.[21],"[21] Agh, fegooish arrys cooie, Dy jean ny bioee ooilley cherraghtyn.] The 1899 translator appears to have misread ‘dy jean’ as ‘dy jeean’. A closer translation of these two lines would be; “But, without proper repentence, All the living will perish’."
"Lhig diuish as dooys, ta bio er-mayrn,","Let you and me, who are still alive,",
Lesh jeeanid cree hirveish yn Chiarn ;,"With earnestness of heart serve the Lord,",
