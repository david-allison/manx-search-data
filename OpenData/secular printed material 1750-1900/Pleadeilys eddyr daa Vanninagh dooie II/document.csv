Pledeilys eddyr daa Vanninagh dooie.,Conversation between two native Manxmen.,
(Juan as Illiam meeiteil.),(Juan and Illiam meet.),
"Illiam.—Wahll Yuan, kys tou goll er bwo? Vel oo rea rish y Heral? Vel oo er lhei ny niaghtyn noa bentyn dan Chiare-as-Feed?","Illiam. —Well Juan, how are you going on boy? Are you finished with the Herald? Have you read the latest news concerning the Keys?",
"Juan.—Cre ny niaghtyn tou meanal? Cha vel mish er vagin nhee erbee noa ayn eddyr, age [i.e. agh] dy vel y pobble geearree dy beagh reamys oc rei yn Chiare-as-Feed. Dys shen te ooilliu cheet erlhiams—cryd elley?","Juan.—Which news do you mean? I haven’t seen anything new there at all, except that the people want to have freedom to elect the Keys. It all comes down to that, I think —what else?",
"I.—Oh ta ny smoo na shen. Tarad nish taggloo jeh jannoo accan, cha nee da’n Ree, agh dan Chiare-as-Feed ad hene, dy yannoo leigh dy bee ad maghey shoh rheit liorish sleih ny cheerey, as cha nee lioroo hene.","I.—Oh, there’s more than that. They are now talking of making a petition, not to the King, but to the Keys themselves, to make a law that they will be, from now on, elected by the people of the country, and not by themselves.",
J.—Ta’n irrin ayd. Yarrood mish.,J.—You're right. I forgot.,
"I.—Ogh ghooinney, shoh eer bree as smuirr y chooish. Ta mish shickyr jeh nagh vel un er hene jehn Kiare-as-Feed nagh jinnagh sideall lhien sy chooish, dy jinnagh shinyn agh jannoo nyn aghin huic hene hoshiaght, geearree ad dy yannoo leigh ad ve rheit ass y noa, ernonney ad ve rheit liorish slane consint y cheer trooid magh ny skeeraghyn. Son instans, fer son dagh skeerey as y chooid elley son ny bailjyn-margee. Cre tou gra rish shen?","I.— O, man, this is the very essence and marrow of the matter. I am sure that there isn’t even one of the Keys that would not side with us in the matter, if we would only make our petition to themselves first, requesting them to make a law for them to be elected anew, or for them to be elected by the full consent of the country throughout the parishes. For instance, one for each parish and the rest for the market towns. What do you say to that?",
"J.—Dy jarroo shinney liams mie yn resoon ayd; as ta mee dy jarroo credjal nagh vel wan [1] oc nagh jinnagh nyn laue dys y leigh, as myr shen settlal y chooish ec slap.","J.—Indeed, I like your argument; and I do indeed believe there that there isn’t one of them that wouldn’t put their hand to (vote for) the law, and so settle the matter at a slap.",[1] wan—Anglo-Manx; ‘one’.
"I.—Boy veen cren yllagh veagh trooid yn ellan, scoltagh ad ny creggyn faggys lesh eam. Boy leh cren boggey vees orrin y laa shen!","I.—Dear boy, what shouting there would be through the Island; they’d split the rocks nearly with shouting. Boy-lad, what joy would be upon us that day!",
"J.—Ta mish dy slane jercal rish y laa shen, Illiam; as son yn oyr shoh. Injyms dhyt ryd foddee nagh row fys ayds er roie. Tan chooid smoo jehn Chiare-as-Feed er e hon. Tar ad slane kiarit, ta mish toiggal, dy yanoo soiagh jeh accan huc liorish y theay, as gialdyn feaysley.","J.— I am fully anticipating [2] that day, Illiam; and for this reason. I’ll tell you a thing that maybe you didn’t know before. The majority of the Keys are in favour of it. They are fully determined, I understand, to admit a petition made to them by the public, and promise a remedy.","[2] jerkal—In the Manx Bible the meaning is usually ‘expecting’, but in eighteenth century writing it is often used with the meaning ‘hoping’. Here it is taken to mean ‘anticipating’, other translators may disagree with this. [Any of 'expect, hope, anticipate' would do here. MWW]"
"I.—My te dy feer myr shen, Yuan, cha voddagh Manninee ryd sdoieagh y yannoo na cheet er nyn doshiaght, as cur y chied chynce daue, as eisht heeagh sleih cren aght harragh ad er.","I.—If it is really like that, Juan, Manx people couldn’t do a more decent thing than go ahead, and give them the first chance, and then people would see how they would get on (would go on / would progress).",
"J.—Veagh eh foddey sloo dy hrubbyl, as cheumooie jeh shen, veagh eh ny sesal [3] yannoo, as ooilliu cheusthie jin hene. Veagh Manninee goll lesh e cheilley dys yn obbyr, as cha nee roostey nyn dhoin dys joarreeyn, as ginsh daue ayns Sostyn nagh voddagh shin jannoo n’egooish oc. Ayns Mannin veg veen sy tra tayn cha vel keesh orrin agh lheid as ta shin goaill soylley jeh. Ta keeshyn er ny queelyn, —wahll, ta raaidyn mie ain; ta keeshyn er ny moddee —wahll, ta droghadyn noa jeant; ta keeshyn er ny thieyn oast —as cooid lhisagh ve, son tarad jannoo wite assee liorish miolagh shann vlebbinyn as scollagyn litcheragh dy iu, as dy chur mow nyn saaseyn meaghee. Nish ta ooilliu ny keeshyn shoh currit magh er ny raaidyn ain, as ta shin sauail liorish; son ta ny queellyn, as ny cartyn, as ny greinyn, as ny crowyn cabbil ain ceau foddey sodjey dooin.","J.—It would be far less trouble, and besides, it would be easier to do, and all internally to us. Manx people would be co-operating on the  job, and not baring our bottoms to strangers and telling them in England that we couldn’t do without them. In dear little Mannin at the moment there are no taxes on us except such as we get the benefit of. There are taxes on wheel s—well, we have good highways; there are taxes on the dogs —well, there are newly-built bridges; there are taxes on the pubs —and an amount there ought to be, because they cause so much harm by tempting old fools and lazy youths to drink, and wiping out their livelihoods. Now all these taxes are put out on our highways, and we are saving by means of it; because our wheels, and carts, and machinery, and horseshoes wear far longer for us (last us far longer). ","[3] ny sesal: ny s’easal — ‘easier’; standard Manx: ‘ny sassey’."
"I.—Ta ghooinney; as lurg ooilliu, she yn Kiare-as-Feed ren y leigh hug ny keeshyn shoh orrin.","I.—Yes, man; and after all, it’s the Keys who made the law that put these taxes on us.",
"J.—Dy beagh lesh shen, dy beagh ad er nyannoo dy chooilliu ren ad chammas shen, cha row oyr son plaiynt.","J.—If it were that way, if they had done all they did as well as that, there wouldn’t be cause for complaint.",
"I.—Wahll, wahll, hee main. Lhig aue ve rheit liorish y theay, as eisht——","I.—. Well, well, we’ll see. Let them be elected by the public, and then——",
"J.—She, as eisht bee yn sleih cooilleenit. As my hig accan my raadys laccal signal, verryms my laue huggey.","J.—Aye, and then the people will be satisfied. And if a petition comes my way wanting signing, I’ll put my hand to it. ",
"I.—Verryms neesht. Oie vie, Juan.",I.—So will I. Goodnight Juan.,
"J.—Oie vie ayd, Illiam.","J.—Good night to you, Illiam.",
