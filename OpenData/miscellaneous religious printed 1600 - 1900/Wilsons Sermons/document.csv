Why, they are called Christians, though they do not the things which Christ hath commanded them.

Let this dreadful truth, I beseech you, oblige you, at this time, and at all times, to hearken with attention to the word of God.

And I see plainly, from what I have heard this day, that my Repentance will signify very little, if I do not bring forth fruits answerable to amendment of life. Is it not a great mercy, that God will accept of a sinner’s repentance, after he has done so many ill things? Is it not great condescension in the Son of God to give us even his oath that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men; and that none ought to despair of mercy, but such only as will not be persuaded to forsake their evil ways? What a mercy is it that I have time to repent, and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. And what a foolish, what a wretched creature should I be, if I should neglect such a mercy, and go on in my sins, and to my destruction? I will therefore, through the Grace of God, not defer my repentance for one moment, lest I be overtaken in sin, and be for ever undone. ",

You may, indeed, do so; but if you have any concern for your own soul, you will think better of it, and reason with yourself after some such manner as this: —I now see the great sin of neglecting so necessary a duty as is this of Prayer. I see plainly, that I must renounce all pretence to religion, all hopes of salvation, if I neglect it any longer. I am convinced, that all the sins I ever committed, and which I have not confessed and begged pardon for, do stand in judgment against me. And what will become of me if I die in this condition? —And I have all the reason in the world to believe, that God will withhold his blessings from me, if I do not give him thanks for those I have already received. I have no reason to hope for God’s protection and blessing upon myself, upon my children, or upon my labours, when I never pray for them. I am as subject to afflictions, to troubles, to calamities, as other people: How shall I bear them with patience without the assistance of God’s grace? How shall I escape the many temptations to wickedness which I meet with daily, without praying for God’s help and direction? In short, if I neglect this duty, how shall I escape eternal misery? —I am resolved what to do. —I will, by the grace of Almighty God, omit this duty of prayer no longer, lest I come short of Heaven, and be for ever undone. [5] I will, as I have been instructed, take all occasions of praying to God. When I set about any business of moment, I will pray him to prosper my honest endeavours. Whenever I shall perceive that I have done any thing amiss, I will forthwith pray God to forgive me, and to give me grace to do so no more. If I am in trouble, or in distress, I will apply to the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort. If I am in any danger, I will pray him to deliver me: if I am tempted to any sin, I will beseech him to succour me. And I will not fail to give him thanks, whenever he bestows any blessing upon me.

","Let us again suppose, that the sermon which you have heard has been concerning the meaning, and benefit, and duty, of receiving the lord’s supper. A serious person can hardly choose but make some such observations and resolutions as these: —I have this day been invited to partake of the Lord’s Supper;— an ordinance appointed by Christ himself, and for this reason: —That Christians being often called upon to remember the love of their dying Saviour, and the occasion of his death, which was to make their peace with God, they might love him with all their soul, and remember to observe the commands he has given them, in order to fit them for Heaven. I am assured, that this is the only way to render our persons and our prayers acceptable to God; of obtaining the pardon of our sins, the grace of God, and everlasting life after death. I understand what duties are required to make me a worthy guest at that holy table. I must resolve to forsake those sins which cost Jesus Christ his life: And I must forgive, and love, and do good to others, since he has been so good and so kind to me, as to lay down his very life for me. I dare not, therefore, I will not, turn my back upon an ordinance upon which my salvation depends. If I am not fit to go to this sacrament, I am sure that I am not in the way of life; I must be under God’s displeasure. I have nothing, therefore, to do, but what through God’s grace I will endeavour to do: And this is —to prepare myself as well as I am able; and for the rest, to trust in the mercy and goodness of my Saviour, to supply, by his grace, what is wanting on my part. And I shall easily know whether I have been a worthy communicant or not, by the life I lead afterwards. ",

I see how blind those people are, who hope to go to Heaven with[6]out endeavouring to please God and to keep his commandments. I hope I shall never forget a truth I have heard this day— that Religion, and the way to please God, does not consist so much in observing the outward duties of Christianity, as in leading an holy life. I see plainly, that a man may go to the church, and to the sacrament, without being just, or humble, or devout, or temperate or charitable. And that the reason why we go to church, and pray to God, and hear his word, is this— that we may obtain his grace to enable us to lead a sober, a righteous, and a godly life. This, therefore, through the grace of God, shall be my great endeavour for the time to come, —to walk worthy of the religion I profess, and of the hopes I have of being happy when I die. ",

In short, I see plainly, that now is the time in which I am to chuse what I am to be, for ever and ever.

I see too, that all the commands of God, all the duties which he has prescribed us, are all intended in mercy to keep us from ruining ourselves. And that if we had been suffered to follow our own wills, or the evil customs we contract, or the bad examples we meet with, we could not escape bringing upon ourselves destruction. I am left, therefore, without excuse, and I shall dearly pay for if I do not deny myself every thing which God has forbidden me; and if I do not look upon his commands as the only way to life and happiness everlasting.",

You may return home without laying these things to heart; but then be assured of it, you return home without God’s blessing. You may refuse to come to church, (as the manner of some is) and think yourselves too good to be taught, reproved, or put in mind of your duty; but what will this end in? Why, you will in time forget God, his commands, and all that is good. You will come at last to say, with those wicked people whom Job speaks of, [Job xxi. 14.] who said unto God, “depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.”",

","When our Lord bids us take heed, we may be very sure it is concerning something of great moment, and therefore to be seriously attended to. And we find it is so here. Take heed, saith he, how ye hear. —Your salvation depends upon your understanding and believing what you hear. —For whosoever hath, —that is, whosoever hath benefited by what he has already heard, God will increase his knowledge and his graces. But whosoever hath not, —have not minded what they have heard, or have not profited by it, such careless people, by a just judgment of God, shall lose that knowledge and those graces which he had given them.",

They are the [9] Ministers of God that watch for your souls. They read and preach to you the word of God, delivered by his own Son. They explain to you the commands of God, which are designed to make you happy for ever. And they put you in remembrance of the promises of God, if you be obedient; and of his severe threatenings, if you despise his goodness. Remember, therefore, what the Son of God said to those that heard this word, and would not mind it: “It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for such careless people.”",

","If you have seriously attended to such a discourse, you will think thus with yourself: —I am now convinced, That without faith it is impossible to please God. I see plainly, that it is not a matter of indifference, whether we believe or not, since Jesus Christ himself has declared, “That he that believeth not, shall be damned.” And that it is as absolutely necessary to salvation that we believe—not what we please, but— “according to the faith once delivered to the Saints.”",

","Our Lord himself has told us, “That if we believe not in him, we shall die in our sins.” John viii. 24.

It is sufficient to me to know and believe, that God would have all men to be saved. That Jesus Christ his Son has shewed unto us the way of salvation. That he has reconciled us to God. That he will be our advocate with God for our pardon, if we truly repent us of our sins. That God will afford us all manner of assistance by his Spirit, to overcome all the corruptions of our nature, and all the difficulties we shall meet with. That he will make us happy for ever, if we strive to please him during this short life: And that we shall be most miserable when we die, if we die in our sins unrepented of.",

Do the promises [10] of God affect my heart, and make me desirous to be made worthy to obtain them? Do the judgments of God upon wicked people, which are recorded in the Holy Scriptures, make me take warning, and fear to draw down the like judgments upon myself? Have I a just value for the Christian Religion, and its ordinances and Ministers, and for whatever has any relation to God? Have I a love for the Gospel, and for the truths contained in it; and do I resolve to govern myself according to them? Do I consider what a dreadful thing it is for a Christian so to live as if not one word of the Gospel were true? Do I hate sin as most displeasing to God, and hurtful to my own salvation? Do I distrust myself and my own strength, and put my whole trust and confidence in God? Do I constantly pray for his grace to increase my faith, and that I may be able to live as becomes my profession? —If I do this in the sincerity of my heart, then I may be assured that I live by faith; and that I have a principle of a new life, which, if I do not stifle it, will in the end bring me to everlasting life and happiness.",

It is to speak of God after the most respectful manner, that others may learn by your example to love and reverence him. It is to be pleased and rejoice when God is honoured; when things go as God would have them; when justice, piety, and charity, do thrive and are encouraged; and to be grieved when God’s laws are transgressed, neglected, or despised. Lastly, it is to submit to God’s will, and what he orders for you; and to suffer any thing rather than knowingly and wilfully to offend God; and to deny yourself every thing which you have reason to believe will displease him.",

In order to this, I will often call to mind the many blessings which I have received from God, that I may give him thanks for them, the surest way to increase my love for him who has been so good and kind to me. I will read or hear his Holy Word with care, that I may know his will, his promises, and the great reward he has proposed to his faithful servants. I will abhor and avoid all such persons, principles, company, and conversation, as may lessen my esteem for and love of God. I will not let the love of the world possess my heart, lest I forget God, and forget that he is my only good. And because love amongst friends is soon lost for want of conversing with one another, I will go to God daily, and lay my wants and my desires before him: particularly, I will beg of God to pour into my heart such love towards him, that I may love him above all things, and that his love may be the commanding principle of my life.

And they are pleased with such men, and such arguments, as tend to lessen their belief of a future state, and a future account. So dreadful is the sin of hating i. e. of not loving God.",

You will be careful, therefore, to remember what you have learned from Christ himself, as well as from his Ministers; i. e. whom you are to account your neighbour, and how you are to shew your love to him.",

That the poor shall depend upon the rich for their subsistence; and the rich, whatever they think of it, shall receive a greater advantage from the prayers of the poor. You will then call to mind how you are to express your love to your neighbour. The command says, you are to love him as yourself. You know, without a teacher, how you love yourself. That you wish and take satisfaction in your own welfare and prosperity. That you are sorry when any evil or mischief befals yourself. You do not love to have your own faults aggravated, or your good name abused; and how ready you are to find excuses for your own mistakes. In short, you know very well how you would have others to shew their love for you. And that it is no small comfort for the ignorant and unlearned, that their duty is contained in so few words, and that they can easily understand it, by considering how they love, how they would be dealt with, themselves.",

I will therefore do no wrong to any man, though I could hope to be never so great a gainer by it. I will not oppress, over-reach, vex, or harrass others, though it should be in my power. I will not envy my neighbour’s prosperity, nor bear malice in my heart, though I could never so well conceal it. I will despise no man living for the meanness of his condition, or for the misfortunes that may have befallen him; knowing very well, that we are all subject to misfortunes, to failings, to every thing that may make a man contemptible. I will be ready to do good with what God has blessed me, and even glad to communicate, knowing that with such sacrifices God is pleased. I will not render evil for evil, though revenge is sweet to flesh and blood. If any man is my enemy without cause, I will pray that God would convert him; that he will restrain and keep him from evil and mischief, which otherwise will be the greatest injury to himself. I will not say, that my neighbour does not deserve my love; for if God should deal with me according to my deserts, I should be the most miserable creature alive. I will not dare to say, such a man has injured me, and I will not forgive him; because God himself has declared, that just so he will deal with me. I will bear with the infirmities of others, hoping that others, and especially God himself, will bear with mine. I will thus endeavour to express my love to my neighbour out of love to God, who has commanded me so to do; and because I believe it will be most acceptable to the Divine Majesty. And I will beg of God to give me the spirit of love; and that the love of God, and of my neighbour, may be the commanding principle of my life. And, that every night of my life I may lie down to sleep with the same charitable dispositions with which I desire and hope to die.",

That to lead a careless, thoughtless, or a useless life, will certainly bring upon me the sentence of the fruitless tree; “cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground.” I will therefore endeavour to please God, by being as careful of my ways, and as obedient, to his commands, as his grace shall enable me to be. And since he is so good as to allow me to call him my father, I will endeavour to lead such a life as becomes the child of so holy a father. To this end, I will endeavour to understand what the will of God is, and will compare my life with those rules he has given me to walk by, that I may be satisfied whether I am, in truth, in the way of holiness or not. I will not delude myself with saying, that every man has his faults, and that God is merciful: For I understand he is just as well as merciful; that he hates sin in every body; and that if my faults are such as he hates, and has forbidden, and I continue in them, I shall provoke him to deny me the benefit of his mercy, and shall feel the severity of his justice. I will not therefore, as I love my own soul, live in any known sin, but will keep a strict watch over my heart and actions, and deny myself, and part with, any pleasure rather than displease God. Nor will I flatter myself with vain hopes, that I may get habits of holiness hereafter, and before I die; for if I think it too soon to please God now, he may be provoked to deny me his grace, and then I shall never be holy, never happy.",

I am to judge by this of God's mercy when it is abused. I will not venture upon these sins in hopes of repenting before I die; for at the best I can but repent for myself; I cannot repent for those I shall corrupt, whose blood shall be required at my hands. I will not make myself easy, because I may hope to hide my crimes; for I am assured, that God will bring to light the hidden works of darkness, when the stoutest, hardest heart, shall be ashamed and made to tremble. I will therefore endeavour to imprint these terrors upon my heart, and preserve my innocence, as I love my own soul. I will avoid, as much as I can, all temptations to these sins, idleness, intemperance; all company that make a jest of these crimes; all people that have lost their modesty; all whom the devil has inspired with immodest stories, filthy discourse, lewd songs; in short, all that discover, by their idle talk and wanton behaviour, that they only want to be tempted, that they only want an occasion to be lewd.",

That he hath blessed that day, i. e. he has joined an especial blessing to the due observation of it. That it is a day dedicated to the honour and worship of God, and of Jesus Christ our Saviour. That if men were not on these days put in mind of the duty they owe to God; and if certain persons were not by his command appointed to keep up the knowledge of God, and of our dependence upon him, we should soon lose the knowledge of the true God, (as many nations have done) all sense of piety, all concern for what must come hereafter, whether men know, whether they think of it or not.

I am convinced, that if I desire to avoid the greater sins, I must resolve to resist the very beginnings of sin, the very least thing that I believe will displease God; and that if I do not do so, and get once out of God's way, one sin will infallibly lead to another. “I see what blindness, what wickedness, sinners have been capable of, when once they have been left to themselves: That they could neither think, nor act, nor live, like men that had reason. I will endeavour (will every serious Christian say) I will live in the fear of God, that I may never consent to known iniquity. This is the only security against the greatest crimes: To be afraid of those judgments which he has threatened to sinners, and of those ways which he has assured us will be our ruin. I will not, therefore, go against my conscience in the least thing whatever; being throughly convinced, that I cannot take up when I please. I see the danger of continuing in any known sin; if therefore I shall be so unhappy as to fall into sin, I will follow the example of holy David—I made haste (said he) and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

In short, the wrath of God is, in the Gospel of Christ, so plainly revealed against all that live wickedly, that all such as do so will (to make their minds easy) either repent and forsake their sins, or strive to blot the knowledge of God out of their minds, and turn infidels.

They are put in mind of their own frailty, that they may look up to God perpetually, and depend upon his grace. They are over and over again told, that there is no condition of life but what is subject to temptations. That every man living has reason to be upon his guard against the wiles of the devil, since he had power to prevail with Judas to betray the Son of God himself —with the chief of God’s priests to accuse him most wrongfully—and with Pilate to condemn him against his conscience. They have the example of our First Parents, to convince them how weak they are, and what will be the effects of giving way to the suggestions of the [21] devil.

At the same time, God has given me to understand, that before I can be fit for Heaven, my nature must be changed; that I must love him with all my heart and soul, and that, for his sake, I must love all mankind, otherwise I cannot be admitted into that blessed society. He has also shewed me the way how I may attain these holy dispositions, which are so absolutely necessary to fit me for Heaven. That in order to love him with all my heart, I must believe in him, and give entire credit to every thing which he has made known to us. That I must fear him —fear to do any thing that I believe will displease him. That I must obey him—do what he has commanded, and avoid what he has forbidden. That I must submit to all his choices for me, and endeavour that my heart may always go along with my lips in this petition—thy will be done. That I must give him the honour due unto his name; speak of him with reverence; worship him with great devotion; pray to him for what I want; and give him praise and thanks for all his mercies. [28] And lastly, that I must close with the means of grace which he has ordained for my edification, and by which he will give me the earnest of his holy spirit. By observing these rules, I shall come to love God with all my heart, and be qualified for that happiness for which he created me.",

Such is that of our Saviour’s; [Matth. vii. 12.] “whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets:” which, though a general rule, may by a well-meaning Christian, [34] be applied to all our dealings one with another; while those that are resolved to be rich, whatever shall be the consequence, all the rules of the Gospel, though never so well explained, will be of little use to them.[31] But for such as do really make a conscience of their ways, one would endeavour to make their way plain and safe.",

And this is—to take such a gain, advantage, or consideration, as the person with whom I deal would be satisfied with, if he knew my business as well as I do myself, and the reasons which oblige me to take such a profit. Whoever makes this his rule, his conscience will never reproach him of injustice. But if, instead of doing so, men will take all that they can get; make an hand of the ignorance, necessities, or simplicity, of those with whom they deal, they do what they must know to be unjust, and make themselves liable to one of the most difficult duties of Christianity, —and that is, Restitution, without which their repentance will not be accepted of God.",

I will no more go about to prove that restitution is a necessary duty, than I would take pains to persuade you that robbing is a sin. Every man’s conscience, every man who dare ask his conscience, must tell him so. And if any man is easy under the guilt of this sin, he will be easy under the guilt of any other sin.

All servants and apprentices, who neglect their master’s business, embezzle or purloin his goods. All that by false measures or weights impose upon their customers. All that conceal the faults of the goods they sell. All that cheat or over-reach those they deal with. All that by any wicked artifice defraud their creditors of what is their due. All that by smuggling of goods, forswearing themselves, or bribing others, with-hold from the King any part of his customs or other revenues, which the laws of God and of the land have given him a just right to. In short, all that have been either principals or accessaries in wronging any man of any thing, they are bound to make full restitution.” Thus far that good man.",

But by the authority of God, who has forbidden them, by the punishments he has threatened, and by the mischiefs that attend them. Such sins, being committed without remorse are too often forgotten; and, it is to be feared, are too seldom repented of. I will not, therefore, let the love of the world possess my soul, lest it choke the seed of God’s word sown in my heart, and those truths which should keep me from ruin. Such as these: “He that hasteth to be rich, can hardly be innocent.” [Prov. xxviii. 2[0].] That all depends upon the blessing of God, which cannot be hoped for in unrighteous ways. That every man living has a right to be dealt with fairly and with justice. That neither life, nor happiness, consisteth in the abundance any man possesseth. That it will be no advantage to a man to have doubled his talents, if at the same time he has doubled his guilt. That posterity will feel the effects of my injustice; God having declared, that he will lay up the iniquities of sinners for their children. And lastly, “That there is nothing that a man can get in exchange for his soul.”",

And it is as certain, that God will hear us, and grant our petitions, “whenever we ask any thing according to his will [1 John v. 14.]",

They must have been either ignorantly, or carelessly, or wilfully, wanting to themselves, when they return so often from the House of God without benefit, and without a blessing; when it is most certain, that God designed these solemn meetings as the greatest of blessings; as the best opportunity of fitting ourselves for heaven and happiness.",

And so it comes to pass, that Christians confess their sins, without being sensible of the danger of being sinners. They hear the most gracious terms of pardon declared, and the absolution pronounced, without receiving the comfort and benefit [38] thereof. They repeat the most divine and powerful prayer of our Lord, without considering the majesty of Him to whom they speak, or his wonderful goodness in permitting them to come to him as to a father. They repeat his praises in the psalms and hymns without any true devotion; and they hear his word, his commands, his promises, and his judgments, without being moved by them to mend their lives.",

And it is for this reason that all well taught Christians, do fall upon their knees as soon as they come into the church, and pray to God to prevent them, by his grace and spirit. And that the most unlearned Christian may not want words, the church has provided a most excellent prayer, to be made use of before we begin any work of moment; and which all Christians may learn, being so often repeated in the publick service, as follows: —“Prevent us, O Lord, in all doings, with thy most gracious favour,” &c.",

For who can, who dare, say this prayer, and beg of God to prevent him with his gracious favour, and further [39] him with his help, when he is going to do a thing which he knows, or suspects, either to be unjust, unfit for a Christian man to do, or displeasing to God?",

Or suppose this sentence has been read— “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart,” &c. —you may say in your heart, But most unfit is mine to be to God presented, until I have obtained his pardon for the many sins by which it has been defiled. Or if this sentence shall be read— “Turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,” &c. —say secretly, God grant that I may never abuse this goodness and patience of God, which is designed to lead me to repentance. While this sentence is reading— “I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,” &c. —think with yourself with what an humble, penitent heart this poor prodigal said these words, and endeavour to possess your own heart with the same devout affections. Lastly, when this sentence shall be read— “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,” &c. —a devout and penitent soul will pour out some such secret ejaculation as this: The very best of men have need of mercy and pardon; how much more such a miserable sinner as I am! —“I will acknowledge my sin unto God, and mine iniquities will I not hide.”",

Every vice we are fond of, every sin we commit, makes us still more unwilling to think of death. What then would become of us, if it were nobody’s duty to shew us whither our steps will certainly lead us?

But then the corrupt nature of man, [58] which cannot bear to be restrained, strives to pervert the design of God and the Gospel, according to the disposition in which it finds them. They that are atheistically disposed, think they see objections enough, not to believe it. Of them that do believe and receive the Gospel, very many have only the form of godliness, but know nothing of the power thereof. Many hold the truth in unrighteousness; many run into sinful pleasures; others suffer the cares of the world to take up all their thoughts and time; while others, who yet think their time innocently spent, are engaged in studies which have no relation to the one thing needful. All these, however, are moved by the very same secret spring, viz. the satisfaction men find in forgetting themselves, and the design of the Gospel, which is—to make us holy, that we may be happy.",

By that word also we come to know our own condition; that we are sadly fallen from that state in which we were created; that we are become the objects of God’s anger, and of his compassion; that he is pleased to offer us pardon upon the most reasonable terms; and has given us all possible assurance, that if we make this word the rule of our faith and manners, we shall be the care of his Holy Angels while we live, and be very happy when we die; that to bring this about, he calls us by his ministers to repentance. By them, i. e. by baptism administered by them, we are admitted into his houshold, which is the church, by which we become his children, and heirs of the kingdom of Heaven.

Then I explained the means which God has appointed to bring that design about. Such are, his Word and Sacraments, his Ministers, and his Sabbaths. After this, I shewed, how little the generality of Christians are affected with this gracious design of God, for their good; how little they esteem it; and how indifferently they comply with the means ordained by God for bringing that design about.

If, upon examining his conscience, he finds that he does any thing contrary to what the Gospel prescribes, he is ashamed and sorry for it; begs God’s pardon, and his grace to observe it better for the time to come; watches over his inclinations; avoiding every temptation that may lead him to sin; never consulting the world, its authority, its customs, or its frowns, for what he ought to do, or what to avoid.

Accordingly; when our Blessed Saviour came amongst men, he invited such only to be his hearers, to whom he knew his doctrine would be acceptable: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.” And when he was blamed for conversing too freely with publicans and sinners, he silenced his adversaries with this reason and answer: “They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”",

And therefore, when a certain publican, to testify the sincerity of his repentance, resolved to part with his estate rather than not do every body right, that he had before wronged, Jesus Christ assures him, that his having been a greater sinner than ordinary will be no hindrance to his salvation: “For the Son of Man,” saith he, “is come to seek and to save that which is lost.” [Luke xix. 10.] That is, such as out of a sense of their misery apply to Him for health and salvation.",

Human laws, fear of shame, of reproach, and many other worldly considerations, may restrain a man from crimes that other people are guilty of; and yet, such a man may be an utter stranger to the fear of God. Whereas such as truly fear God, are not led thereto by any earthly consideration whatever; but they have seriously considered their own great corruption, and God’s infinite purity; their own sad deserts, and God’s severe justice; they cannot but acknowledge the justice and holiness of his laws, and yet they find in themselves an unwillingness to obey them. They are sure that without God’s grace they cannot do anything that is good; and yet they find in themselves a strange backwardness even to ask that favour and assistance. They know, that they live upon his bounty, and yet they cannot find in their hearts to be thankful. These are both instances of great disorder, and must needs make them liable to God’s displeasure. They profess to believe, “that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good;” and yet they are apt to sin as presumptuously as if they were indeed hid from his sight. They hear how severely he threatens those that transgress his laws. They have seen his judgments upon other sinners, and they know not how soon it may be their own case.",

For it was to people thus affected and thus disposed, that Jesus Christ spoke, when he said, “Come unto me, all that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” And indeed it is purely for want of such dispositions as these, that the Gospel is preached without effect; that Jesus Christ, and salvation through faith in him, is offered even to us Gentiles, who before were in darkness, and in the shadow of death; and we scarce esteem it a favour, because we are not sensible of the sad estate we are in without the blessing of a Redeemer.",

Thirdly; that those who have felt the burthen of a troubled conscience, and have been once truly afraid of the wrath of God, may ever after walk more circumspectly.

You see how people come to differ; some believing, and others slighting, the very same truths.

They would not, and they pretended they could not, believe “that he was sent from God;” they despised his message; they would not receive his doctrine; they gave no heed to his miracles; nor would they have patience, or be at the pains, to see whether this was He whom the prophets did say should come. In short, they could not say what would convince them, if neither a doctrine worthy of God, nor works which none but God could do, were not sufficient. Jesus Christ, therefore, without giving them more proofs, or the sign they demanded, positively pronounces their judgment in these words, “now they have no cloak for their sin.”",

Thus Moses begins the history of the creation: —In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.” Supposing, most truly, that he who has his eyes open, and does [115] not, from the greatness and beauty of the creatures, acknowledge the Maker of them, all the arguments in the world will not convince him.

Now; they being told [Eph. ii. 8.] “that faith is gift of God,” they are apt to conclude, if they have it not, it is not their own fault; and this is their cloak, this their excuse; and indeed it will be a good excuse, provided a man can honestly say, that he hath seriously considered the danger of living in disobedience to God’s commands; that he hath heartily acknowledged, before God, his own inability to keep them without his grace; that he has prayed for God's grace, and followed the motions of his Spirit, as far as he was able; that he has at least done what was in his own power, and kept out of the way of temptations; that when he has done amiss, he has been sorry for it, begged God's pardon, and resolved not to do so again. If a man cannot say this with truth, it is plain he is not in earnest, and therefore want of grace will be no excuse before God, who knows that this is the least of his concern.",

Is it not that we may awake out of sleep? That we may see the danger we are in, and overcome all difficulties, for a few days, that we may escape being miserable for ever? And that we may be encouraged to do so, the Spirit of God has assured us, that our reward shall be great hereafter; our comfort in the mean time such as cannot be expressed; and that we shall have such assistance as shall enable us to overcome all difficulties. We have, therefore, but this choice, either to follow our own inclinations for a while, and be miserable for ever; or to obey the will of God (though we meet with uneasiness) that we may obtain his favour, and be eternally happy. And it is mere [118] folly to expect any other issue of our obedience or disobedience. For thus God has dealt with men since the world began: Such as obeyed him, with their whole hearts, found their advantage in it; and such as followed their own wicked imaginations, were rejected of God, and delivered up to destruction.",

In particular, he has declared, that to the impenitent and unbelievers no mercy shall be shewn, whatever they may hope for. And that we may not mistake his meaning, he has plainly told us, true penitents are such as “bring forth fruits meet for repentance;” and that true faith is such as purifieth the heart. So that if this word be the rule by which God will judge us, and by which we may judge whether we are out of danger or not, we see plainly, that the mercy of God will be of no advantage to us, while we knowingly transgress his laws.

Always remembering, “that without holiness no man shall see the Lord.” That the duties of Christianity are indispensable; that God did never excuse any one of his servants, from the beginning of the world to this day, from observing them faithfully. “That no man can serve two masters;” so that it is in vain to call myself a servant of God, when I do not the things which he has commanded",
Lhig dooin consideral ny sodjey: —,"Let us consider farther, that if we meet with temptations, it was designed we should do so, that we might thereby be obliged to depend more entirely upon God. That if we are sometimes at a loss, it is so ordered, that we may look up to God for light and salvation. That “if we love darkness rather than light,” it is no wonder if we miss our way, and are bewildered. That if we want hearts to set about the work of our salvation in good earnest, it is because we know, in our consciences, that we never sincerely prayed to God to give us grace to do so. That if we are careless because the rest of the world are so, and hope to come off as well as others, it is because we do not consider, that it will be no comfort to be damned for company, no more than it would be pleasure to be poor, or sick, or tormented here, for company.",[The bulk of this paragraph is missing in the Manx; the initial phrases of this and the next are very similar. No doubt the translator’s eye skipped from one to the next.]

That want of capacity cannot be pretended, when we understand things much more difficult to be known. That to put off the concern of our souls to the last, is plainly to value them less than anything else. That to think ourselves safe, because we do not fear any danger, is to be ignorant of a great truth, which is—that people [119] may be given over to a reprobate mind, i.e. a mind void of judgment. Lastly; that such pretences as these will rather increase our guilt, than serve to obtain our pardon, when we appear before God. And the conclusion will be, that he who seeks out excuses for not living as becomes the Gospel of Christ, is only contriving how to shut himself out of Heaven.",

He that dares not do this may depend upon it, he is not in the way of salvation. And he that is once fully persuaded, that without a sincere repentance, a lively faith, and an unfeigned charity, he cannot be saved, will never think of making excuses to free himself from these duties, and the fruit of them—holiness of life. For a man to be at ease upon any other account, or to hope that any thing in the world will atone for want of true piety, is to hope without reason and without scripture. ",

This made David, (though in the main a good man) this made him mourn so bitterly, when, through the corruption of his nature, he had grievously offended God: “I am sore troubled, mine iniquities are an heavy burthen, I go mourning all the day long.” What a dreadful condition had he been in, even to eternity, if there had been no sacrifice for sin?

Our Lord would convince us of the truth of this, in that most affecting parable recorded by St. Luke, [vii. 41.] “There was a certain creditor, which had two debtors: the one owed him a very great sum, ten times as much as the other. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Which of them will love him most? Certainly he to whom he forgave most.” I shall conclude this particular with the observation of a very learned man, to this purpose: [Mr. Malbranch in his Christian Dialogue.] “Our Redemption being a work of as great mercy, at least to us, as was that of our creation, we could not but love our Redeemer even as much as God that made us. It was, therefore; absolutely necessary that God should redeem us, otherwise we should have been obliged to have loved a creature equal with God our Creator.”","The latter part of this paragraph after ""whom he forgave most."" is not included in the Manx translation"

We come now to another delusion of Christians, who hope that they may love Jesus Christ well enough without renouncing the love of the world. To prevent this, our Lord has expressly told us, “that no man can serve two masters:” and all thoughtful people have found it so by experience. For, if the love of the world rules in our hearts, the love of Christ will find little entertainment there.

People are justly offended when they see a clergyman set his heart upon the world: and they conclude, truly, that such a man cannot love the Lord with all his heart. But then they should consider, that the same affection for the world in any other Christian, will extinguish the love of Christ; and that all Christians are equally bound to renounce the love of the world, who desire to love God as they should do.","The latter part of this paragraph after ""the loss of Heaven"" is not included in the Manx translation."

He has, therefore, assured us, that they are no mark of God’s favour; that people may want them, and be the happier for it; that such as have lost them may easily make up that loss, by securing a treasure in Heaven; and that this is the use which they ought to make of such visitations of Providence.",

Upon which I cannot but make this just observation: that the great difficulties of a Christian life lie in this, in mortifying our corrupt affections, in weaning our hearts from the love of the world, and uniting them to Christ: not in knowing what our duty requires of us; for this is so plain, that the wayfaring men, though never so simple, cannot err therein. Whereas Christians, for the most part, contrary to all good sense, spend the most of their thoughts, and time, and pains, in getting still more knowledge; and look upon the practice of Christianity as the easiest thing in the world.",

So saith our Saviour, verse 21st of this chapter: “He that loveth me,” i.e. keepeth my commands, “ shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself unto him.”",

If one hates that sin which cost him so dear, if we learn from his humility, his patience, his self-denial, to imitate him, to set our affections on things above; [155] if we read his Gospel with a sincere desire to know his will, and with a full purpose of heart to keep his sayings. Lastly; if we find that our love stirs us up to an honest discharge of the duties of our calling; perfecting holiness in the fear of God; why then we have the witness in ourselves, that our love is such as it should be. But if it does not do this, it is no more than an idle notion.",

Why; that is what I would say in a few words.

It is a difficult thing to possess our hearts with a sincere love of Christ; because we must first renounce all other affections contrary to the love of our Saviour. But then, this convinces us of the truth of Christianity, which requires of us such things as no man ever could come up to, unless assisted by a divine power. And if an infidel will say any thing against the Christian Religion, he must say one of these two things, either that there never was any man who lived up to his profession, which would be a bold saying indeed; or, that God does bless and enable those that love and serve him, to do his will.",

If we consider his wonderful condescension in taking our nature upon him; in submitting to all the hardships of a miserable life, and a more miserable death, in order to deliver us from death eternal. If, lastly, we consider, that we are commanded to honour the Son even as we honour the Father; that whatever we ask in his name, God will give us; that our present and future welfare depends upon his intercession with God for us.

Can a man of the world think that a wise doctrine, which so often tells him, that those that trust in riches, can hardly go to Heaven; and that it is hard to have riches and not to trust in them? In short; can people heartily embrace a teacher, though come from God, who forbids them a thousand things which they are passionately fond of, and which they will have, let what will follow? ",

They may rejoice with his church for company, but they will have no reason for it in the end; for this same Jesus, who came to save us, and to deliver us from the wrath to come, must first deliver us from all iniquity; “from this present evil world;” [Gal. i. 4.] “from our vain conversation;” [I Pet. i. 18.] If we will not suffer him to do this, instead of a Saviour, he will be our Judge to condemn us to eternal misery.",

How then comes it to pass, that this day is not observed with great strictness, devotion, and thankfulness? Why, because people do not consider either the necessity, or the reason, or the advantage, of such a command. I will therefore, before I go any farther, endeavour to make you sensible of the reason and necessity of observing one day in a week according to the commandment.",

Now, it is certain, we should soon forget these things, if one day in seven we were not put in mind of them. To shew you that we most certainly should do so, let us consider how many things every one of us have forgot, which we ought to have remembered. How many mercies do men receive from God, which they soon forget? How many judgments doth God send into the world, which are no longer thought on, than whilst the smart of them does last? Why, we should as surely forget the God who sends mercies and judgments, if we were not taught continually to remember him by his day which we keep holy.",

Why, do not we all know that Fasting is a Christian duty; and yet, because God has not in express words appointed us certain times of fasting, how few are there who observe any at all? And, though the church of God has appointed days of fasting, yet they are neglected, despised, and the very duty itself questioned, and almost forgotten. And so it would be with the Lord’s day, and the Lord himself, if it were not expressly the command of God, “remember that thou keep holy the sabbath-day .”",

The son at first did not see his father’s meaning, or the reason of such a command, till at last, being often alone, he began to think of himself; which, by the grace of God , ended in his conversion; and then he did not only retire because his father had commanded him, but because he found it reasonable, his duty, and pleasure so to do.",

He, therefore, told his disciples, before he suffered, that he was to suffer, “and that after three days he would rise again.” [Mark ix.31.] “I tell you before it come, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.” [John xiii. 19.] A way of reasoning which our Saviour made use of on many occasions, and therefore thought it a sufficient argument.

This was, to them, a sure argument, that the hand of God was in all this;—that Jesus Christ was the beloved Son of God;—that they had not been deceived in any thing that he had said, or done, or told them. For they were very sure, that God could not give his testimony to a lie;— or require them to lay down their lives for an untruth. And, therefore, when they affirmed, “That Jesus Christ was risen from the dead,” they only said what they knew for certain, what all their senses assured them of;—and therefore they did not stick to seal the truth of it with their own blood.",

For the Spirit of God tells us, [Dan. xii. 2.] “That they that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” So that, in truth, the Resurrection of the Body is like to be no blessing to such as shall rise only to be for ever miserable.",

St. Paul tells us of those that live in pleasures, “they are dead while they live.” [1 Tim. v. 6.] The Father saith of his Prodigal Son, [Luke xv. 24.] “This my son was dead, and is alive again.” The Sacred Scriptures speak of wicked men, as past feeling; that is, having no sense of good or evil, no more than if they were dead; as being in darkness; not knowing whither they are going, or what will become of them. Nay, as being actually dead—""Even you being dead in your sins;” saith the Apostle.",

For we are not able of ourselves to do any thing for which we were created. ",

And now, if we consider what has occasioned this great disorder, we shall find, that sin, and sin only, has done it. “By sin,” (saith St. Paul, Rom. v. 12.) “death entered into the world;” not only natural, but spiritual death. And this is what we are most concerned to know and to lay to heart; for if we continue in a state of death, which sin has brought us into, we shall be for ever miserable without redemption.

Man was at first created in the image of God,—in righteousness and true holiness; that is, he was able to act conformably to any law which God should [437] think fit to give him. We are very sure that it is not so now with us. The Holy Scriptures, and they only, can inform us how this came to pass; and they tell us, [Gen. ii. 16.] that man being thus created, there was a covenant of life immortal made with him, by which his natural appetites being restrained, he might the better improve himself in all virtue, until God should think fit to translate him from earth to heaven.

Ean xvi. 7.,John xvi. 7.,
"Ny-yeih ta mish ginsh diu yn irriney; T’yh ymmyrchagh er nyn son mish dy gholl roym: son mannagh j’em roym, cha jig Fer-ny-gherjagh hiu; agh my h’em’s roym, ver-ym hiu eh.","I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.",
"   Dy beagh yh ny bare da e Ostyllyn, as as son nyn vondeish, dy jinnagh Creest fagail ad, va ny lessoon creoi, as va nyn Saualtagh eginit dy loayrt roo ayns aght nagh row cadjin da, dy gherjagh ad: Ta mish ginsh diu yn irriney.","   That it would be better, and for their advantage, that Christ should leave his disciples, was a hard lesson, and our Saviour was forced to use an extra-ordinary way of speaking to satisfy them:—I tell you the truth.",
"   As nagh der shoh son dy dy bragh ny host resoooney mee-hushtagh gheiney, as cur orroo ginjillaghey ad-hene gys creenaght Yee, ayns ooilley ny t’eh dy oardrail; as dy yeeaghyn er shen ny ta eshyn dy yannoo dy ve son y chooid share, cre wheesh erbee as [398] t’yh noi nyn dreishteil na nyn yeearreeyn: Dy beagh yh ny bare son y seihl dy jinnagh Creest, va er n’yannoo wheesh dy vie ayn, fagail yh;—dy beagh yh ny bare son e ostyllyn, va er ve er nyn goadey, er nyn ynsaghey, as er nyn gherjaghey liorish e chione-enish, eh dy gholl roish voue.","And will not this for ever silence the corrupt reasonings of men, and oblige them to submit to the wisdom of God, in all his dispensations; and look upon that to be the best which he does, how much soever it contradicts their hopes or desires?—That it would be better for the world that Christ, who had done so much good in it, should leave it;—that it would be better for his disciples, who had been preserved, and taught, and comforted, by his presence, to have him depart from them. ",
"   As ny-yeih va shoh ny bare dauesyn, as son y seihl neesht.

For, when Jesus Christ had satisfied the justice of God by his death, he (according to his promise) sent down the Holy Ghost to teach and to comfort them, to convince and to convert the world.",

That we may all be truly thankful to Christ for this great blessing, and very careful not to grieve the good Spirit of God, by which we are sanctified; it will be proper to consider these two particulars.

And first; we may see what we are by nature, by considering the condition of mankind before the Gospel was published ; as well as by looking upon those parts of the world where it is not yet received.",
"   Ta ny Scriptyryn Casheric dy feer vaghtal genmys stayd sheelnaue my jagh yn Sushtal er ny phreacheil, ny stayd dy ghorraghys: “Va shiu keayrt dy row dorraghys, agh nish [400] ta shiu soilshey;” [Ephes. v. 8.] ta shen, Va shiu roish nish nyn Yallooderyn, agh nish ta shiu nyn Greesteenyn.

And it was truly a state of darkness;—they were subject to the prince and powers of darkness; they were engaged in works of darkness;—they were ignorant of the true God; they were without hopes and without promises.",
"   As shoh myr t’yh ec y laa jiu, rish ooilley ny aashoonyn shen nagh vel foast er ghoail-rish yn Sushtal; t’ad fo lheid y phooar as reiltys yn Jouyl, as ta cur er dy chooilley Chreestee mie dy ghoail chymmey jeu.

To see creatures like ourselves worship the sun and moon, and cry for help to creatures that cannot hear nor help them;—to see them worship those very evil spirits which delight to afflict mankind,—is what should make us seriously to value the blessing of knowing better things.",

Let us but seriously think of it, that whatever differences there is [sic.]  amongst men, if one man is in any thing better than another, it is purely owing to the good Spirit of God; for we are all born in sin and prone to it, and though we have reason and understanding, yet we may see into what errors it would lead us, by observing into what errors it leads others. ",

And will any man on earth pretend to govern himself by reason better than they did? ",

And though this may look strange to one who finds in his breast an abhorrence for some vices, and supposes that he should die rather than be guilty of them; yet he may, perhaps, change his thoughts, when he considers, that there are few people who, in many instances, do not come to be in love with vices, which once in their lives they had a hearty dislike to. The Holy Scriptures have given us several very noted examples of this. “Am I a dog,” said Hasael to the Prophet, “that ever I should do such vile things?” And yet, for all this abhorrence, he did those very wicked actions. “Though I die with thee,” saith St. Peter, “yet will I not deny thee in any wise;” and yet, being left to himself, to make good that resolution, you know how it ended.",

But if we shall neglect or despise God's assistance, and, by depending upon ourselves, yield to temptations, the Spirit of God will forsake us, and we shall become the Devil's servants, and be very miserable both in this life and another.",

They had reason and innocency to support them, and they, notwithstanding, fell; instead of which, we have an Almighty Hand ever with us to assist and guide us, and a faithful promise of such a reward as by nature we have no right to; and if at any time we fall, we have an Advocate with God, ready to make our peace upon our true repentance.

So likewise, if we are under any outward afflictions, as sickness, loss of friends, loss of  goods, or the like; we know, by the Word of God, that nothing comes by chance, but that all things are ordered by the providence of God for the good of his creatures; and that these are ways by which the Holy Ghost would make us sensible of our errors, wean us from the love of this world, and make us desirous of a better. And, therefore, it is said, concerning afflictions of this kind, “God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.” [Job xxxiii . 14.] ",

And that we may have it for asking, our Blessed Saviour has assured us, after a very sensible manner: [Luke xi. 13.] “If ye, being evil, know how to give good things unto your children, how much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” ",

Whoever considers the meaning of that word, cannot but be very thankful. But then, let us at the same time remember, that, as we hope for any benefit by his death, we must suffer him to redeem us from this present evil world, to make us holy, that we may become worthy to escape so great a misery.",

And a very necessary enquiry this will appear to be, when, we remember, that our acceptance with God, and our salvation, depend upon our having such a good-will towards all men, as becomes members of the same family, of the same body, of the same hope and faith.",

Even all such as have no true sense of the blessing of a Redeemer, and consequently no true value or love for Jesus Christ;—all such as live in any known sin;—all such as are not sincerely resolved to live, and be governed, by the Laws of God;—all such as live at variance with their neighbours;—all such as have done wrong, and do not make restitution and satisfaction according to their power;—lastly, all such as go to the Sacrament in mere compliance with the laws and custom, without considering the ends and benefits of receiving:—All such go unworthily to the Lord’s Table, and return without a blessing.",

For, saith he, [John vi. 26.] “Except ye eat the Flesh,” the Sacramental Flesh, “of the Son of Man , and drink his Blood,” his Sacramental Blood, “ye have no life in you;” that is, nothing but this can sustain the divine life of a Christian.",The Bible reference in this paragraph is incorrect in the English but corrected in the Manx.
